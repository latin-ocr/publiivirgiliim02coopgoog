Daphnis me melus urit, ego hane in Daphnide laurum.
Ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnim.

Talis amor Daphnim, qualiS. cum fessa juvencum
Per nemora, atque altoe quaerendo bucula' lucos,
Propter aquae rivum viridi procumbit in ulva
Perdita, nec serae meminit decedere nocti:

Talis amor teneat: nec sit mihi cura mederi.
Ducite ab urbe domum, mea camina, ducite Daphnim.
Has olim exuvias mihi perfidus ille reliquit,

Pignora chara sui ε quae nunc ego limine in ipso,

95. Moerie ipse dedit
has herbae

serra, tibi mando: dehent hoec pignora Daphnim.
Ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnim.

Has herbas, atque haec Ponto mihi lecta venena
lpse dedit Moerie, nascuntur plurima Ponto.
His ego saepe lupum fieri, et se condere sylvis
Moerin, saepe animas imis excire sepulchris,

Atque satas alio vidi traducere messes.

Ducite ab urbe domum, mea cai-mma, ducite Daphnim.
Fer eineres, Amarylli, foras: rivoque fluenti,

Aggrediar nihit'ille Deos, nil carmina curat.
Ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnim
