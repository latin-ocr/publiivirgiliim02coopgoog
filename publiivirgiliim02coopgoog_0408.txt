Infelix. Utcunque ferent en ficta minores,
Vincet emor petr-iffi, laudumque immensa cupido
Quin Decios, Drusofique procul, saevumque securi

Aspice Torquatum, et referentem signe Camillum.
111ae autem, paribus quas fingere cernis in armis,
Concordes enimn nunc, et dum nocte premuntur,
Heu Ξ quantum inter ee bellum, si lumina vitm
Attigerint, quantae acies stragemque ciebunt!
Aggeribus socer Alpinis, etque arce Monoeci
