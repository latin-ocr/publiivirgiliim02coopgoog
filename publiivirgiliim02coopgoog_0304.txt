makes Belus an abbreviation of Illiobalus,
the father os Pygmalion and Didoz but he
follows sabulous and traditione accounts,
which should always be receive with cau-
tion. Among other things, what rendere
bis account doubtful, is, that he brings Dido
upon the stage os action more than a him-
dred years before the destruction of Troy.
After the death of his father, Pygmalion
ascended the throne. He was an avaricious
prince, and stopped at nothing by which he
could increase his riches. He conceived the
plan os murder-ing Acerras, o? sicharbas, the
beloved husband os his sister. virgil calls
him sichem, sostening the name to make
it ssow more easily into his verse. siciamus
vas the richest os all the Tyriam. Pyg-
malion eoveted his treasuresz but there was
no way to possess them while he was living.
He therefore formed the purpose of taking
away his lise. He came u on him unex-
pectedly, and “slew him whi e he was per-
seming his devotions before the altar. This
tuocious dced, the base prince had the ad-
dm. to cone-eal, sor some time, from his
sister. At length the whole matter was laid
01)οῦ to Dido by the ghost os her deceased
husband, and she was admonished to fiee
her country. Having collected what trea-
mre she could on so sudden an emergency,
*nd seizing some vessels that were then
ΝΜ] for sea, she set sail, accom anied by
many οἵ her countrymen: and, a er a long
md tedicus voyage, she arrived in Africa.

her countrymen, who, many years before,
nudor Xorus and Carchedon, had sormed a
seulement, ιο which they gave the name os
Utica, about 15 miles from the place where
Mis now stands. This place was aster-
’Καὶ rendered famous by the death of the
”cond Caro, who was hence called Cato,
Uticensis. Dido met with a welcome rocep-
tion, and was desired to build a city on the
‘Pet where she lauded. For this purpose,
ὦ* purchased a tract of country of the na-
ῑῑῖα, many of whom joined her, together

dutmyed by the Romans under &ipim-in
ΨΘ year os Rome 608, and before Christ
145. See Rollin's An. His. lib. ii. ch. 1.
'i'lisre ars some who say that Dido, on

her arrival in Africa, found Carthago al-
ready built, and that she only fortificd it,
and added a tower or citadez, which she
called Byrsa. This word is evidently from
the Hebrew Basra, which means a fertilita-
tion, or sortified places The Greeks, mis·
taking the meaning, or overlooking it, sup-
posed, from the similarity of the words, that
it was the same with their Byrsa, which
means a bull’s hide. Virgil followed the re-
ceived opinion. See AEn. i. 367. lt has been
tho general opinion that virgil, in malmin}
AEneas and Dido cotemporary, is guilty o
an anachronism. Bochart is positive of this,
and says that au the ancient chronologers
of any eredit, place the destruction of Troy,
at least 60 years before the reign os Saul,
king of lsrael ς and the time of Dido's build-
ing Byrsa, the sorti-ess of Carthage, at least
200 years aster it, making 260 years to in·
ten-ene between the destruction os Troy,
and the building of Byrsa. ln this caso, the
destruction os Troy will bo 1160 years be-
fore the Christian era. Sir Isaac Newton,
however, in his chronology, has brought it
down nearly 300 years: and thus makes
AEneas and Dido cotemporary. However
the case may be, it was undoubtedly a re-
ceived opinion among the Romans, that they
were cotemporary, and this was sufficient
for the poetz and even is he hnew otherwise,
he acted prudently in following the general
opinion, since it contributed so much to tho
embellishment of his poem.

Jamdudum: a long while. Servius ex-
plains it by ninivis», or vehementiae. Though
it were only a short time since AEneas came
to Cart-hage, yet, with respect to Dido's
passion, and the impatience os her leve, it
