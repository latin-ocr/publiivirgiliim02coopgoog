the eon of Peleus, king of Thessaly, end ’

Thetis, ι goddess of the een. While he was
en infant. his mother dipped him au over in
the river Styx.. to render him invulnereble,
except the beel by which eho held him. He
we· concenlod among the daughters os Ly-
comedes, king of the island of Scyros, in
female apparel, that he might not go to the

sor hie friend Patroclus, whom Hector had
ulain in battle. And he was himself elain
by Paris, with en arrow, which piei-ced hie
beel, while he was in the temple of Thym-
brion Apollo. He ie sometimes called Pe-

38. Teucrorum. The Trojano were eome-
times called Teucri, from Tem-armna of their
founders. See note 1. eupre. By Rea
Teuc-rorum we are to understand AEneu. It
seems now to be the purpose os Juno to

41. Ajacis Oilei. There were two percon·
at the siege of Troy, by the neme os Aju.
The one here meant wan the eon of Oileus
kiae of the Loci-iane. He went with forty
ships against Troy. The other wne the
son of ‘Palemon king of Salamin, nn inland
in the Sirius Sar-«micus, between Animam
