Objicit. Ille fante rabida 'tria guttura pandens‚'

Corrupit objectam, atque immania terga resolvit
Fusus humi, totoque ingens extenditur antro.
Occupat AEneas editum, custode sepulto,
Evaditque celer ripam irremeabilis undoe.

Continuo auditae voces, vagitus et ingens,
Infantumque animae flentes in limine primo ε

Quos dulcis vitae exsortes, et ab ubere raptos
Abstulit atra dies, et funere mersit acerbo.
Hos juxta, falso damnati crimine mortis.
Nec vero hae sine sorte datie, sine judice, sedes.
Quaesitor Minos urnam movet: ille silentum
Conciliumque vocat, vitasque et crimina discit.
Proxima deinde tenent moesti loca, qui sibi letum
insontes peperere manu, lucemque perosi
projecere anima. Quam vellent aethere in alto
Nunc et pauperiem et duros perferre labores!
Fata obstant, tristique palus inamabilis unda

42⁷. Infamemque anime. The wailings
οἲ those infant ghosts or shades, considered
only in a oetical light, are very properly
dispo-od ο in the entrance os Pluto's king·
doni, as they cast a melanchely gloom over
the soene, and excite such tendor passions
in the mind of the render, as prepare him
for relishing the beauties of so grave and
'oleum a representation. But then their la-
mentation and weeping we are not to con-
sider as the effect of punishment, so much
as sn expression os their grief and sorrow
st being taken away by an untimely death.

428. Etr-sortes duleis vius .· deprived of
sweet life, and matched from the breast, διο.

Remis says, ρπύαιοε.

vidson says, ⁰⁸ an untimely grave.''

430. Domum· mortis„ That they should
be punished who suffer death under a salse
diunge or accusation, may at first view ap-

nnjust. Tliough they were innocent
ef the crime for which they were condemn·
ed, it does not follow that they were wholly
l'ree from fault, and innocent in their lives.
And according to the doctrine of the Platonis
philosophy, none could have access te the
