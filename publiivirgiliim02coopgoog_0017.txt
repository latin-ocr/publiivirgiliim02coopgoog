poet of that ago, ond a friend equally os Pollio and Maenas. Between these
two favorites of the Muses there subsisted, during their lives, the most coi-dial
sticndship. How sincerely they esteerned each other, wc ma'y leam from an odo ·
which Horace asserwards composed upon the occasion of vin-gira setting ..ιι for
Greecc, on account os liis health.

Having completed the Georgics, our poet soon commenced the AEnoid an
epic or heroic poem. This is the noblest species of poetic composition re-
quiring a correct judgment, a lively imagination, and an universal knowledge.
Virgil possessed them all ιιι a high degree. lt ι. supposed that he had the sul»
joct in contemplation for several years previous, and that he alludcs to it ‘m the
sixth Eclogue ιιι these words·

cum canerem rege· et prolia, C thiu· aurem
vellit et admonuit. Pastorem, ityre, pingue·
Pucsre oportet ovea, deductum dicere cumen.

He probably had something of the kind· ιιι view3 but whether it was, what tho
AEneid astcrwards proved to be, is uncertain.

The subject of the poem is the removal os a colony of Trojans from Asin
Minor, under the conduct os AEneas, and their settlement in ltaly. The Iliad
and Odyssey undoubtedly suggested to virgil the idea os the AEneid3 and with-
out the former'we should not have had the latter.

lt has been supposed by some, that the fssneid was designed merely as an

labor, by composing short pieces, or brief panegyrica upon his prince, as
Horace did on several occasions. lt is true, virgil was very fond of compli-
menting the Caesars, and in several parts os his works, he has done it in the
most extravagant manner.

The AEneid was'undoubtedly designed for the benefit and instruction of the
Roman people generally, who were now happily enjoying the blessings of peace,
aster having suffered. for a series os years, all the calamities of civil war. The
poet wished these blessings to be perpetuated. He, therefore, endeavors‘ to
dissuade his countrymen fnum further attempts to restore the republic, and ad—
vises them to submit to the ffltliority ol‘ a man who derived his origin from the
godS, and under his auspices, to cultivate harmony, and the ιιι. of civilized lise.
This is the moral os the poem, and an object worthy of the patriotism and
benevolence of the p.oet

Virgil wrote withp a wonderful degree os exactness. Every thing which he
mentions is founded upon historical truth3 and the voyage and adven tures os his
hero are given with geographical precision. He has also given us a fun and
perfect account of the religious rites and ceremonies os the age. The whole so
ansully blended with the subject, and so skilfully interwoven into it, as to bo·
come an essentia} part os the poem. And while he is delighting the l'ancy with
the harmony of his numbers, he informs the understanding, and erilarges, the
bounds of our knowledge.

As soon as it was known that Virgil had commenced the AEneid, the public
