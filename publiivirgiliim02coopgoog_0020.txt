Or the several kinds of poetry, none is more generally admired than the ⁸

pastoral. Its subjecta, the variegated soenes of the country, the innocent
unployment of shepherds and shepherdesse8, possess char-ms which never
fail to please and interest our minda. But this speeies of poetry is difficult in
execution ; which may be the reason that there have been so few, who excell-d
m ιι.

Isthe poet were to make his shepherd talk like a courtier, a philosopher, or
a stateeman, we should immediately perceive the impropriety; or were he ιο
make him utter low and vulgar sentimenta, we should turn from him with dis-
gust. The medium is the true course. To maintain thia, however, at all
times, is no easy matter. Ι

Theocritus was the only pastoral writer os eminence among the Greeks,
aad virgil among the Romans. The former denominated his pastorale Idyma,
the latter Edogoe. Vir-gil, however, cannot ao properly be called-an original
pastoral writer, as an imitator of Theocritus. Many· of his finest touchee are
taken from the‚Grecian. He imitated him, however, with judgment, and in
some respecta improved upon him, particularly in preserving the true charae·
ter os pastoral simplicity 3 in which the other on many occasions failed.

The word Bucolica is os Greek derivativa, and signifies pastoral songs, or
the congs of shepherds. Vin-gil denominated his Bucolica, Eclogoe,· which ia
ubo from a Greek word signisying to choo-re or select out ο . The Eclogueu
ff: then, a aelection of choice pieceS, such as he thoug t worthy of pub-

tion.

He began this part of his worka in the twenty-ninth year os his age, and ιιι
the year os Rome ⁷¹33 and finished it in the space os three years· The
Ecloguos we're so well received by his countrymen, that they were pronounced
publicly on the stage. After hearing one of them, Cicero, it is said, did not
hesitate to say os him : Diagnoe epea altera Romoe.

Ῐι appears to have been the design of virgil in writing his pastorale, to cele-
brate the pruinas of Augustus, and os some other of his friends at Romo, pu.
ticularlv Maecenas and Pollio.
