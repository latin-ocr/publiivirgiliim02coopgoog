NOTES.

ehade os Pelles. Eight prisoners were sent
ee victims to be offered at the funere! pile of
Pallas. 'I'he poet mentions this circum-
stance, without any expression of disappro-
bation. It is true. Achilles, in the Iliad,
does the seme thing at the tom'o of his friend
Patroclus: but he is represented as a person
os ι very different character from AEneae,
the hero os the AEneid. And moi-eover, the
loss which he had sustained was more se·
vere, and his grief more poignant. But
above an, he lived in a stete ot* society ver
different from thet iri which virgil live .
'l’heue things serve in some measure to miti-
gate the enonpity of the deed. And et
‘ there is one pesa e os Homer, which u-
etathius understen e es eonveying a strong
censure of the herbernus eet.
