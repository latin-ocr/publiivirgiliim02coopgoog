NOTES.

lus tulit .· this death carried him off (sorte),
bdy divine appointment. This is a singular
i iom. The several circumstances here
mentioned in the death of Priasn, a gravate
the cruelty of the action, and set orth the
ferocious temper of Pyrrhus. He drew him
(naxia) trembling with age and det-ay of
nature, to the very altar where he had ssed
for safet ς and slipping (lapsantem) in the
blood o his son; the sight of which was
worse than death: then he twisted his hair
n ith his left hand, and, with his right hand,
trew his glittering eword from its ecabbcrd,
uid plunged it into his body up to the hilt.
Here we have a lively picture of a man lost
to all sense of humanity, and capable of
perpetrating the most atrocious deeds. It
shows, also, the pen of a. master. A painter
could copy it.

556. Pergama .- neu. plu. properly the fort
of Troy. Itis frequently taken for the city
iteelf, by synec. Here itis used in its appro-
priate sense and meaning, as distinguished
from the city.

555. V Mentem .- it agrees with illum.

557. Superbum regnatorem: the proud rulcr
over sc many natione and countries of Asia.
Priam ia said to have once reigned ovcr

the greater part of Asia. Minor, or Natolia.
Ruoeus interprete the words thus: Regem
adsim, clarum propter to! genter, ee tot regiona.

Others say that Priam was not elain at the
altar: but drawn by Pyrrhus to the tomb of
hie father, which wan on the promontory of
sign-um, and there elain to appense his
Manes. He may have been elain at the al-
tar, and his dead body astet-ward cast upon
the shore. This supposition will make the
poet consistent and intelligible. Regnator-em
put in apposition with illum.
