inat touched hie body.

333. suggere .· give to me the darte, διο.

339. Hasta protinus missa. It ie generally
thought by commentatore that the earne
cpear which killed Maeon, also wounded
Alcanor in the arm. But it ia difficult to
conceive that a javelifi, aster it had pmed
throu h a slticld of brasc and a bremt plato,
should retain ao much force aa to paea
through the body of, a man, and in ite
course wound another person in the arm;
and, aster thia, that it should continue ite
way come distance. Some conjecture they
were different weapona: and for thie there
ia considerable ground of probability. Thone
who think there wa! only one apear, rely
much upon the word protinus, which they

aide, Alcanor did not reize hie brother till he
was m the act os falling, and the dart, con-
sequently, done ita execution, and passed
fi’om the body on ita way. Granting that
terail-way is the proper meaning of pretiatis
in thie place, may it not refer to the quick-
noea of AEneae iu repeatin hie throwc, aa
well oe to the motion os tie dart? Astur
all. tlte ⁴zupponition os there bcing two duta,

After AEneas had killed Micon, obaervi
hin brother in the act of supporting him, an
