Deponunt, animos nil magnoe laudis egentes.
lpei transtra novant, flammisque ambesa reponunt
Robora navigiis: aptant remosque rudentesque:

Et lucus late sacer additur Anchisaeo.

to transtbn designate, or appoint.

751. Deponunt : they leave-—oet apart.

755. Designat urbem. 'hia refers to a
eastum ot* the Romana, who, when they were
about to build a city, first marked out the
boundary of it by drawing a furrow with a
plough, which they lifted over those space·
where they intended to have the gates.
Hence porea (from porto, to carry) came to
signisy a gat-e.

756. Hoc, Ilium .· history mentions no city

in Sicily by the name os Ilium. AEneae may
have called it ιο at first, but agreed that
Acestes should change its name afterward.
0r Ilium may be the tower of the city Aces-
ta or Segesta, and hore taken sor the whole
city b aynec. aa Pergamus, the tower or
ciudelvos Troy, is osten put sor the city it·
·elf. Thia ie the opinion of Ruaeun. Strabo
mentions two rivers near the city Segesta,
by the narnus os Xanthus and Simois, and
that they were'ao called by AEneaa.
’ 758. Indiciesoram: he appointa courta os
justice, and givos lawe to his assembled
senators. 'rho Roman senators were called
Patren, either on account os tlueir age, or to

759. Erycino: an adj. from Eryx-,a moun-
tain in Sicily, in height next to AEtna3 stom

temple to his mother Venus on the top ns
uni· mountain. Some say it was soundrd

prus. 'rhi- whole island was sacred to Ve-
nus. Sedes .· in the sense os templum.

761. Lvoeus additur. A prio-t and grove,
sacred far araund, ia added to the tomb of
Anchisen. lt appears hence that he wa·
buried on Mount Eryx. Some say that h·
arrived in Italy along with his son: others
that he diod before he arrived in Sicily.

762. Gens: in the nense ospopulas. 'l'he
verb suerat ie to be connected with epulata.
Honos sactus: in the sense os sacrficium

sactum erat. All hin people had kept the

anniveraa'ry festival os his father for nine
days, and performed the usual offeringn,
when the wcather became favorablez and
having repaired the damages occasioned by
the fire, they make ready for their depart-
ure. Here a most interesting scene ensued.
A day and a night they paea in embracing
each other betore their final separation.
Thone who before were weary of the vo
age, now sammon up cour-age, and are wi l·
ing again to encounter the danger os the sea.
The interesting scene brought tears from the
hero'a e ea.

768. aarum. 'Phia ia the usual reading.
'Phe sense is, that the divinity, or divine
power, cy· che sea, seemed to them insupporta-
ble—more than they could endure after all
their fatigues. But Heyne, upon the au-
thority os Heinsius, reads nomen. Tho senae
in this case will be: and the name os m
aeemed insupportable to them. They could
not bear to hear its name mentioned. Νο-
