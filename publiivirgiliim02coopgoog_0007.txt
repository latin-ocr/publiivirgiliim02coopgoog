iv . RECOMMENDATIONS.

Bam-most, Oct. 20, 1825.

The edition os the Works os Virgil proposed to be published by the Rev. J
G. Cooper.. appears to me, as far as a very partial examination os it has enable-‚d
me to judge‚ to be a work os merit, both as to the plan and execution. And 1
am persuaded, that its adoption into our Colleges and Seminaries os learning
will greatly facilitate the acquisition os a correct knowledge os that elegant
and distinguished poet.

So iar as 1 have had opportunity to examine the manuscript os the Rev. J.
G. Cooper for a new edition os the Works of Virgil, 1 highly approve os the
plan, and think it well calculated to facilitate the study of the poet. It appears
to be a leading object with Mr. Cooper‚ to lighten the burden of the student,
by elucidating the difficult passages os the author, and by leading the youthful
mind into a relish os his beauties and excellencies. ·

The substitution ol* an Ordo of the most intricate passages in the room of a
general interpretation of the text, 1 consider a material advantage. While it
removes the difficulties in the collocation os the words, it leads the student more
directly to the text, and tends to fix his attention more closely upon the language
os the poet. On the whole, Iconsider the work deserving os public patronage:
and 1 wish him every encouragement in his endeavours to promote the interests

. of classical literature.

Having been favoured with the perusa] of notes upon the Works of virgil.
compiled by the Rev. J. G. Cooper‚ together with an Ordo os the more intri
cate parts of the text, 1 am fully persuaded they are well calculated to assist the
younger classical students to read and understand the poet, especially in the
more difficult passages3 to enlarge the mind in the Geography os the country.
and to explain the mythology of the age in which he wrote.

The criticisms on the text are generally correct, and display an intimate
acquaintance with the syntax os the Latin languagez and 1 do not hesitate tu
say, that in my opinion, the work would be very useful in the Academies ar t
Seminaries os the United States.

An edition of the Works of virgil, upon the plan adopted by the Rev. J. G

From a partial examination os the manuscript copy os the Works os Vir-gil,
with English notes, ἄιε. by the Rev. J. G. Cooper‚ it appears to have been
prepared with much labour and care. l have no doubt that a work os this kind
would be os essenual advantage to classical students, especially to those who
