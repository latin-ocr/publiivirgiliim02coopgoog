Ab! timidos nautas canibus lec-crasse marinis?

Aut ιιι mutatos Terei narraverit artus?

(λικε illi Philomela dapes, quae dona pararit?
Quo cursu deserta petiverit, ct quibus ante

lnselix tua tecta supervolitaverit ulis?

Omnia quo, Phoebo quondam meditante, beatus
Audiit Eurotas, jussitque-ediscere lauros,

puleae referunt ad sidera vallem
Cogere donec oves stabulis, numerumque referre
