smne distance from the city, bearing his aged father upon his shouldern, und
leading his little son by the hand. He was followed by at numbers of hi-
munti-ymen, who had escaped the flames and the swm . At Antandrum
mall town in the neighborhood of Troy, he built him a fleet of twenty ships,
and having furnished himself with all things necessary for his enterprise, set sail
tn search os a new settlement. He visited Thrace. Here he founded a city
which he called AEuos. He abandoned his undertaking at the directim of the
host of his friend. Thence he sailed to Crete, the land of Teucer, one of the
ounders of the Trojan race- Here he attempted a settlement, but,through ths
unhealthinoes of the climate, was compelled to relinquish it, aster losing a great
number of his companions. In the midst os his distress, he is insonned in a
vision, that Italy, the birth place of Dardanus, was the land desthned to him by
the goda. Upon this informationi he lest Crete; and, after various fortun- by
sea and land, he arrived in Italy in about seven years after his departure from
his native land. He was kindly received by Latinus, king of Latiam, who pro-
to bestow upon him his daughter Lavinia, the heiress of his kingdom.
urnus, king of the Rutuli, a brave and valiant prince, had long sought her in
marriage. He opposed her connexion with AEneas. This occasioned a bloody
war, in which most os the Italian princes were engaged, on one side or tho
other-⁰ lt ended in the death of Turnus, which closes the AEneid.

AEneas afterwards married Lavinia, and succeeded Latinus in his kingdom.
He built n city, which he called Lucerum, in honor of his wife. This he made
the seat of his government. He was succeeded by Ascanius, or liilus, who
oeigned thirty years, when ha built Alba longa, to which he removed with h's
court. Here the government was administered by a line of Trojan princes for
three hundred years, till Romulus arose, who founded the city of Rome. Aster
Romulus, the royal line was broken, and the government transferred to N uma
Pompilius, ,ι Sabine. ⁸ ”

The three first books are not arranged in the order of time. The second
book, which relates the downiitll of Troy, and is the basis of the poem, is the
first in time. The third, which relates the voyage of AEneas, till aster his
departure stom Sicily for Italy, follows. The first, which relates the disper·
sion of his fleet, and his arrival in Africa, with his kind reception by Dido,
succeeds the third. The rest are all in theorder of time. But this change,
so flu from being a defect in the poem, is an advantage, and shows the
judgment of the poet. Ha was enabled thereby to make his hero relate the
downfall of his country, and the various fortunas of his long and eventful
voyage.

The poet hath contrived to introduce into his poem the outlines of the Ro-
man history, and a number of interesting episodes, which add to the whole
beauty and entertainment.
