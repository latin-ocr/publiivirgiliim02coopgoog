lar or alder mes. Phaethonemdas. These
were the sistere of Phaethon, or phasson,
and daughters os the sun. They were
sometimes called Heliades. Their names
were Phaethusa, Lampetie, and Lampadium.
Phasim imprudently desired of his father
the management of his chariot for one day.
Phobus refused for a long time. But, at
lut. overcome by his importunity, he con·
sented. He was, however, soon convinced
of his mimam sor the horsea, perceiving
‹an unusual driver, became impatient os the
rein-3 and when they had passed the meri·

dian in their course, and began ιο descend,-

he was no longer able ιο restrain them, and
the youth was thrown headlong from the car
into the Eridanus, or Po. His sistere grieved
immoderately at this missor-tune of their
brother: and were changed, some say, into
poplar trees, others say, into alder trees.
See ovid. Met. Lib. 2.

tia, rising at the foot of mount Helicon.

66. Omnis chorus. Here virgil pays Gallus
a very high compliment as a poet3 and he
does it in the most delicate manner. They
roso up in his presence, to do him honor:
murrae-rit viro.

67. Linus. See Ecl. itt-56. Carmine: in
the sense of versibus.

70. Ascroeo seni .· to the Ascrean e
Hesiod3 who was anative of Ascra, a town
ef Beotia not far from Helicon. He was a
celebrated poet.

⁷1. Quibus ille, διο. It is said of Orpheus,
um tho lossy oaks bowed their heads, and
listened to the charms os his music. The
same effecte are ascribed here to the music of

Hesiod. It is the highest compliment thar

74. Scyllam. There were two by the
name of Scylla: bne the daughter os Nisus,
king os the Megarenses, who, falling in love
with Minos, king os Crete, as he lay siege
to Megara, betrayed ber father ιο his enemy.
For which deed, it is said, she was changed
into a lark3 while he was changed into a
hawk. See nom. prop. under Nisus.

The other was the daughter of Phorcus.
Some there are, who think virgil here con·
founds the two, attributing to the formet
what properly belongs to the latter. But
there will be no need of this, if we only sup·
ply the word eam, ur inam.

The story of Se lla, the daughter os
Phorcus, is briessy tiis: Glaucus, the eea

od, feu in love with her, but she refused

is addresses. ln order ιο render her more
favor-able to him, he applied ιο the sorce-
ress Circe3 who, as soon as she saw him,
became enamoured with him herself ς and
instead of affording him any assistance,
endeavored ιο divert his affectione from
Scylla, and fix them on herself, but without
any effect. Por the sake of revenge, Circe
poured the juice of some nexione herbe into
a fountain, where Scylla used ιο bathe her
sels. And as soon as she entered it, ιο her
great surprise, she found the parts below
her waiet changed into friglitful monster-a,
like dogs, that were continually bui-king or
making a growling noise. The rest of her
body assumed an equally hideous form.
This sudden and unexpected metam erphonis.
filled her with such horror, that she thre!
herself into that part of the sea, which di·
vides Sicily from Italy, where she becamea
rock, or rather a ledge os rocks. See aa.
