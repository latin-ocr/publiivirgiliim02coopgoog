lpse labore ananum duro terat; ipse feraces

Figat humo plantas, et amicos irriget imbres.

Atque equidem, extremo ni jam sub fine laborum
Vela traham, et terris festinem advertere proram,
Forsitan et pingues hortos quae cura colendi
Ornaret, canerem, biferique rosaria Paesti:

Quoque modo potis gauderent intyba rivis,

Et virides apio ripae3 tortusque per herbam
cresceret in ventrem cucumis: nec sera comantem
Narcissum.. aut flexi tacuissem vimen acanthi,
