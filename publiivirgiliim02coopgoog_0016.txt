About this time, at the suggestion of Pollio, virgil commenced writing his
Eclogues3 which occupied him three years. The [rst was written to express
‘ his gratitudo to his prince for the restoration of his lands. This he -did in so
delicate and modest a manner, that it raised him greatly in the esfimation of
his stiends and countrymen: and the poet conferred a greater favor upon
Augustus, by immortalizing this act of his beneficence, than he did by restoring
to him his lands. The others were written upon various occasions, and for
unffi ‘'Elei-3332 were extremely popular. So well were they received, that
they were several times repeated upon the stage. Cicero, upon hearing thern,
was so much pleased, that he did not hesitate to say of the author: Magnae spes
altae Rom, which words the poet afterwards introduced into the twelsth book
of the AEneid, applied to liilus. virgil may be considered the first who iutro-
duced pastorals among the Romans. It is a fact worthy of notice, that he was
the introducer, and at the same time the perfector, of this kind of writing. All
succeeding poets have taken him as their model, and found the sur-est way to
success to be, to copy his beauties. lt is true, he was much indebted to
Theocritus, who was the first pastoral writer of eminence among the Greeks .
but he followed him with judgment, and improved upon him so much in
correctness of taste, in purity of thought, and delicacy of expression, that we
lose sight of the original. So much was he e'steemed, that all classes of per-
sons crowded to see him, w‘nenever he appeared in public ς and on entering the
theatre, the people rose up to do him reverence, no less than to Augustus

During the civil wars, agriculture had been much neglected : and so gene-
ral had the distr-ess become on that account, that serious apprehensions were
entertained for the peace of Italy. All classes of people began to murmur, and
to cast the blame upon Augustus, and his adrninistration. ln this state of
things, it occurred to MaecenaS, that the most effectual method of aver-ring the
impending evils, and of restoring peace to the people, and confidence in the
administration, was to revive the agricultural inter-ests of the country. F or this
purpeoe, he desired Virgil to write a treatise upon agriculture. He well knew
no person was better qualifled for a work of this kind. He possessed an
extensive knowledge of the subject, a correct teste, and could enliven it with
the charms of poetic numbers3 and he already possessed the confidence and
affectioni· of his countrymen.

Afier a short respite, he entered upon the work. That he might be less
mterrupted in its prosecution, he retired from Rome to Naples, a city more
tranquil, and, at the same time, more healthy. In this pleasant retreat, removed
stom the bustle of the capital, the intrigue of courts, and the jarring interests of
politice, he composed the Georgica—a poem, the most perfect and finished of
any composition in the Latin language. He spent seven years in the work.
The public expectation was raised high ς but it was far surpassed: and Virgil
conferred a greater blessing upon his country, than if, in the field, he had ob
mned tlte most splendid victory over its enemies.

The Georgica were every where well received, and Italy soon assumed a
flourishing appearance. The people found 'themselves in the enjoyment of
peace, plenty, and domestic happiness. The poet dedicated the work to his
friend Maecenas, a statesman distinguished equally for his love of literature and
ucience, the correctness of his politics, and the wisdom of his counciIS.

Virgil was now forty years of age. At this time, he found himself in the pos·
sesdon of a large estate, chiefly from the liberality of his prince. His fame was
coextensive with the empire, and the lovers of the muse courted his society.
Among the particular friends of Virgil, may be reckon ed Horace, a distinguished
