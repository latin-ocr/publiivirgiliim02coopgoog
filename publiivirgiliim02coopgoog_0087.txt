NOTES.

167. Omnia que memor.- all which things,
being provided long before hand, you should
be mindful to lay up.

168. Divim' ruris. Tho country is here
called divine, either on account of its inno·
oenoe and happiness, or because it was ori-
ginally the habitation of the gods. Gloriae
reward. Ruoeus says, laus,- for divini, he
says, beati. ·

171. Seio-pe: from the back part, or bot—
tom.

372. Binoe aures.- two mould or earth
beardo, one on each side os the temo, or
beam. The poet here mentions the several
parts of the plough. The buris, or bura,
was the part which the ploughman held in
his left hand—the plough tail. The dentale,
, the chip, or part of the plough to which the
nomer, or share, is fastonod. Duplici dorso .·
with a double back. Some understand du-
oles in the sense os lanas,- but there is no
need of this. The plough. which the poet
is describing, is altogether of a singular
kind to us. It had two nnould-boards3 two
chips or share-beams we might supposed it
to have had, one on each side os the temo,
or naain bearn, which, being joined together,
might not improperl y be said to form a.
double back. Seiva .· the handle, which the
ploughman holds in his right hand.

1723. E! levis mia. Tulin, the finden, or
lime-trec. lt is a light vueod, and therefore
more suitable for the plough.

174. Quoe torqueat .· which may turn the
lowest whcels from behind—may turn the
extremo-or hinder part os the plough. The
plough here described we may suppose run

upon wheels, which is the reason of the
poet's calling it eurr-tu. ι carriage. nunus
says: qmbusdam in regionibus erasm in-
struitur rotis,- but commentatore are by no
means a ed as to the form and construo-

tion of t iis plough os the poet.

175. fumus explorat. Wood uuoned in
the way here mentioned will be lea-lisbio
to crack or aplit, than if seasoned in the
usual way, in the sun ²¹¹& open air.

180. Victa pulvere: overcome with dry-
neas, should crach. Pulvere. Ruous says:
“⁶515 “m-⁶15.“th¹z“.‘255.22f mm

183] Tolpdz copti oeulis. Ίὶιιὲρα, the mole.
a small animal, supposed to have no eyes,
and living chiefly under the ground.

184. Busa.- the toad. Monstrum, pro-
perly significa any thing contrary to the
ordinary course os nature; also, any niis-
chievous animal, whether man or bruteg
which is the meaning here.

186. Curculio .· the weavel; a mischievou!
animal among grain.

187. cmcmptaeor item, διο. observo in
like manner when the nut-tree in the woodo
clothes itself abundantly with blooms. Οἳ
the nut-tree, there are several kinds. ‘rho
one here meant is supposed to be the Ar»
mygdalo, or almund-tres, beeauw its flow-
ers or blossoms were supposed to be an in·
dication os the’fertility of the year. Plu·
rima.- an adj. sup. agreeing with nux
'rhi- construction frequently occurs, and is
more elegantly translated by its correspond-
ing adverb.
