makes Dido imprecate·upon AEneas a series
os missortunes, which actually had their
avcomplishment in his own person, or in
his posterity. Aster his arrival in Italy, he

md warlike prime. He was torn from the
etnbrsce of his son, and as it were an exile,
forced to go to Etruria, to implore the as-
sistance os Evander. See AEn. viii. 80. He

Carthaginians were bitte-r enemies to each
