Supplicia expendunt. Alite panduntur inanes

P. VIRGILII MA RONIS

740

Suspensae ad ventos: aliis sub gurgite vnete
lnsectum eluitur sechia, aut exuritur igni.

Quisque suos patimur Manes. Exinde per amplum

tions were ot the deepest dye, were burnt in
the firo- 'rho elementa, air, waterss and fite,
are of a purisying nature, and have been
figurativcly used by all writers as emblema
ot moral purification-

743. Qui-tque patimur: we all suffer every
one his own Ναηεε. This passage bath
very much perplexed commentatore. It is
not certain in what sense we are to take
Manes. The ghosts, or Manes of the dead,
were supposed to haunt and disturb the liv-
ing, from whom they had received any great
:ztffztndssfss‘a‘sszffltt ‘Zssffrssffigmssssffi‘fi'f
the lower world. According to Plato, every
person at his birth hath nesi ned him a ge-
nium or demon, that guar s him through
life, and aster death accompanies him to the
chades below, and becomes a minister of
purification. By «Uener we may understand
these I’Iatom’c demens. Some understand
by ,Μιιηω the stings and sterce upbrnidiugs
of a guilty conscience. These every offend-
er carries about with him, and by these
means becomes his own tormentor. Paei-
mur Mam-³ is the same with patimur suppli·
cium per Manes. The above is the usual
acceptation of the words. In the present
instance Heyne differs froin the current of
interpretem. He confessos it a perplexed
and intricate passage, and conjectures it was
102st in an unfinished state by the poet. That
part of the dead which the ancients called
,Μαηεε they placed in the infernal regions,
while the umbra remained upon earth and
the sou! ascended to heaven. He takes
Qui-mue suos patimur Manes, in the sense of
muttum omnium Manes patiuntur .· vel, ista
supplicia psalt-rada omnibus Manibm. His
ordo of construction is: nos Manes patimur
quisque quoad mos. According to the no-
tion of Plato and others, all must undergo
purification before they could be admitted
to Elysium, to the loeea arva. Now as the
Manes alone descended to the shades below,
they alone could suffer: Hi sunt, qui pur·
camur.- qui patiunmr: qut subeunt illos

neral opinion of commentator-s that the ordo
