NOTES.

Ι 10. Laetam-mm. 'Phe shedding of tem
ιε an indieetion of compassion end humeni-
ty. lt is not inconsistent with true fortitudo
end greetness of mind, und no way unbe-
coming n hero. But there is no necessity
os understanding it herc, and iu various
other passages where it occurs, es is AEneas
actually shed tesrs. Ruoeus takes it in the
sense of lugens, grieving at the idei os
leaving his native country, and et the pros-
pect of tho dangers which were before him.

12. Magnis Οἱς. The great gods were
Jupiter, Juno‚ Mers, Pallas, Mercury‚ end
Ap01103 sometimes called the Dii majorum
gentium. The Penates were domestic gods,
without any particular name. The images
os all these gods AEnees took with him into
Italy, and introduced their worship, as we
ere told, into Lae-ium, aster he was settled
m that kingdom. Some take the Magnis
Die to be the eume with the Penatibus.
See Geor. ii. 505. end AEn. ii. 717.

13. Mavortia terra .· e martial land.—
Threce is so called, because said to be the
uirtnplece of Mars. This was a very exten·
sive country, bounded on the esst by the
Euxine seu, south by the Propontis, Helles·
pont, end AEgoan see, and on the West by
Macedonis. Colitur: in the sense of habi-
eatur. Procul. This word sometimes sig·
nisies near, in view, ss if pro oculis, as in
cel. vi. 16. In this eenee it may be taken
hen-033 sor Thrace was only n. short distance
from the port where AEnees set smil. But it
may have reference to Carthago, the place
wherehe then wmu end then it may be
taken m its usual acceptation.

14. Acri Lymgo: werlike Lycurgus. He
was the son oi Dryas. Be‘mg offended et
Bacchus· it :s snio, he beniebed him end bis
veterius from h‘s kingdomg and ordered an
une vinos to bo destroyed m hie dominions.
For which nnpiety the god deprived him of
his signi. lim-mea, refers to ωηατ govern-
sd, or ruiod. ‚
