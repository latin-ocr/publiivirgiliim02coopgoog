Detulit. Ipse Deum manifesto in lumine vidi

latrantem muros, vocemque his auribus hausi.

Doeine meque tuis incendere, teque querelis:

ltaliam non sponte sequor ·
Talia dicentem jamdudum aversa tuetur,

lIuc illuc volvens oculos, totumque pererrat

Luminibus tacitis, et sic accensa profatur:

Nec tibi Diva parens, generis nec Dardanus auctor, 365

Pei-fide, sed duris genuit te cautibus horrens

Caucasus, Hyrcanaeque admorunt ubera tigres.

Nam quid dissimulo 2 aut quae me ad majora reservo?

Num fletu ingemuit nostro '3 num lumina flexit? [est‘t

Num lachrymas victus dedit? aut miseratus amantem

Quae quibus anteferam ’ἕ jam jam nec maxima J uno,

Nec Saturnius haec oculis pater aspicit aequis·

Nusquam tuta fides. Ejectum litore, egentem

Excepi, et regni demens in parte locavi ε

Amissum classem, socios a morte reduxi.

Heu! furiis incensa seror. N unc augur Apollo,

Nunc Lyciae sortes, nunc et Jove missus ab ipso

Interpres Divum sert horrida jussa per auras.

Scilicet is Superis labor e‘st, ea cura quietos

Sollicitat. Neque te teneo, neque dicta refello.

l. sequere Italiam ventis; pete regna per undas.
