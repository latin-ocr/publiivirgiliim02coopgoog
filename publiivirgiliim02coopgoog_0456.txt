AENEIS. LIB. VIII

Accipio, agnoscoque libens! ut verba parentis

Et vocem Anchisae magni vultumque recordor!
Nam memini Hesiones visentem regna sororis
Laomedontiadem Priamum, Salamina petentem,

Protiniis Arcadiae gelidos invisere fines.
Tum mihi prima genas vestibat flore juventa:

hIirabar-que duces Teum-oa, mirabar et ipsum
Laomedontiaden : sed cunctis altior ibat
Anchises, Mihi mens juvenili ardebat amore
Compellare virum, et dextrae conjungere dextram.

Accessi, et cupidus Phenei sub rnoenia duxi.
[lle mihi insignem pharetram, Lyciasque sagittas
Discedens, chlamydemque auro dedit intertextam,
