rence arose whst we cell the four elements,

many other erroneous notione, particularly
concerning the nature of God. He wss nn
Athenien, end born about 840 years before
the Christian ers.. He hed many followers.
32. Anime .- in the sense oseis-is. With-

em‘s: of these first principles or clemente

⁴1. Hine r ere lapides, &c- Aster thet he
relstes the grown stenes of Pyrrhe, bc.
Pyrrhe wss the daughter of Epimetheus,
end wire of Deucalion, the son of Prome·

sey, thet some time during his reign the in-
habitante of the esrth were destroyed by s.
universal del e, except himself end his
wife Pyrrhe.. hey were preserved in ιι
small ship, end carried by the wetere ιο

orscle os Themis concerning the restoration
of the humen rscez when they were in-
formed, ιο cest behind them the hones of
their great mother3 by which they under*-
stood stenes. They immedistel obeyed the
commend of the orscle, end ose thrown

Pyrrhe, women. See Ovid. Met. Lib. 1.

dered Mer-cury to chsin ,him ιο n rock on
mount Caucasus. He did so, end ‘placed
s vulture to prey upon his liverg which,
however, grew es fest ss it was consumed.
