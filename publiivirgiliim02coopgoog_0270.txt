LIB. 111. 251

Sic satus, meritos aris mactavit honores:

Tsurmn Neptun03 taurum tibi, pulcher Apollo;
Nigrum Hyemi pecudem, Zephyris felicibus albam.
Fama volat, pulsum regnis cessisse paternis
Idomenea ducem, desertaque litora Cretae.
Hoste vacere domos, sedesque adstare relictas.
Linquimus Ortygioe portus, pelagoque volamus:
Bacchatarnque jugis Naxon, viridemque Donysam,
olearon, niveamque Paron, sparsasque per aequor
cycladas, et crebris legimus freta consita terris.
Nauticus exoritur vario certa-mine clamor. ’
