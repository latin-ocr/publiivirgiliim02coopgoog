his military achievements. He was a particular friend of Antony‚ and under him
commanded the troops in Cis-Alpine Gaul; in which Mantua was situated.
llere he became acquainted with Virgil‚ who was introduced to him either hy
Varus or Gallus 3 both of whom our poet has mentioned in his Eclogues.. in the ο
most affcctionate terms. ·

After the battle of Philippi, which proved fatal to the republican party, Au-
gustus divided the lands in the neighborhood of Mantua among his veteran
troopS, to whom he was indebted for that victory. Virgil was involved in the
common calamity. This circumstance, in all human appearance to be lamented,
and which to others proved a heavy calamity‚ to our poet was the commence-
ment of an illustr-ioue career, and the harbinger of an immor-tal day.

Pollio, who entertained a sincere friendship for virgil, and was well qualified
to form a correct estimate of his talenta and acquirements, becnming acquaint-
ed with his case, recommended him to Maecenas, who was then at Rome, and
held the highest place of honor and confidence with his prince. The friend of
Pollio found also a friend in Maecenas. He laid hie case before Augustus, and
by his influence with his prince, obtained the restoration of his estate. virgil,
at this time, probably was about 29 years of age. He immediately returned
with the edict of the emperor for the restoration of his farm, which had fallen
into the hands osone Areus, a centurion 3 but he was resisted and ill-treated by
the new possessor, and forced to swim over the Mincius to save his life. This
cruel treatment is the subject of the nmth Eclogue.

He went a second time to Rome upon the subject. But it is probable he
never aster resided upon his estate. A wider field now opened before him 3 and
he made the seat of the empire the place of his residence. Here his acquaint-
ance and friendship were sought by the most distinguished men ; and the favorite
of the Muses became also the favorite of Augustus,

With a view to compliment his prince, and to express the happy state of the
empire under his administration‚ it is said, he composed the following distich,
which, in a private manner, he affixed to the gate of the palace:

Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula mane:
Divisum imperium cum Jove Cesar habet.

Augustus was highly pleased with the compliment paid to him, and the deli·
cate manner in which it was expresse-d ; and he desired to find out the author.
Virgil's modesty and diffidence prevented him from making an avowal. At
length, one Bathyllus, a poet of inferior merit, had the hardihood to claim to be
the author. The emperor richly rewarded him. This greatly mortified our
poet, who wrote the same lines upon the gete of the palace, with the following
one under them:

Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores:

together with the beginning of another line in these words,
Sic vos non vobis,

repeated three times. Augustus wished to find the author3 and as the surest
way of doing it, demanded that the lines should be finished. Several attempta
were made without effect. Bathyllus was not able to do it; which led to a
suspicion of his impostura. · At last Virgil finished them,and thus avowed him-
self the author of the previous distich. The lines are as follow:

Sic vos non vobis nidificatis avenz
Sic vos non vobis vellera fertis evesa
Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes:
Sic vos non vobis sertis aratra «boves.

This detected the impostor, and covered him with ridicule and contempt.
