Gau-amu,

The very favorable opinion that many of you have expressed‚ of the plan
anengxfflon of this Baition ‘ff tlte werke ‘ff Vir-gil, claime my respeetful
cc w ments.

Every attempt to facilitate the acquisition of classical literature will, Ι am
peruiaded, meet your approbation3 1 shall, therefore, offer no apology for
adding this new edition to the many others, already before the public.

Soon aster l commenced the instruction of youth, 1 became sensible of the
impropriety of the use of the editions of Vir-gil, then in our schools. Those of
Ruaeus and Davidson were generally, if not exclusively, read; both equally
objectionable, the former by affording too little aid to the student in the illus·
tration of the text, the latter by affording him too much. It was at this early
period that 1 formed the plan of the present edition. Except the two last books
of the AEneid, it was finished in the year 1815, as you will perceive by the date
of several of the recommendatione. Since which time, they have been com-
pleted, and the whole carefully revised and greatly improved. This delay in
the publication gave me a further opportunity to become acquainted with the
wants of studente, especially in the early course of study, and to collect the
opinions of teachers upon this subject. That opinion has uniformly been in
Ιὶινοι· of my plan3 which takes a middle course between the opposite extremes
of affording too little, and too much assistance to the student.

'l'he partial ordo is designed to assist him in the more intricate parts of the
text3 and where recburse otherwise must be had to the teacher. The notes
and explanatione are copious. They embrace whatever was deemed necessary
to elucidata the poet, and to lead the youthful mind to relish his beauties. Some
of the more difficult passages l have translated3 and, in general, where a word
is used out of its common acceptation, 1 have given its sense and meaning in
that particular place: and where commentatore are not agreed upon the mean·
ing of a word or phrase, 1 have given their respective opinions. In the text, 1
have adopted the reading of Heyne, except in a few instances, where the coin-
mon reading appeared preferable.

To the Bucolica, Georgica, and AEneid, 1 have given, in the first instance, a
general introduction; and to each Eclogue, and book of the Georgica and
AEueid, a summary or particular introduction: so that the student, know-ing
beforehand the subject, and anticipating the beauties and excellences of the
poet, will proce-ed with ease and pleasure, and in a manner catch his spirit.
'I'o each 1 have added a number of questions, to be asked by the toacher, &ml
