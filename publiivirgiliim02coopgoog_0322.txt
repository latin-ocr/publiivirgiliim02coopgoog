AENEIS. LIB. IV. 808
convectent calle angusto: pars grandia trudunt 405
obnixae frumenta humeris: pars agmina cogunt,
castigantque moras: opere omnis semita servet. ο

Quis tibi tunc, Dido, cernenti talia sensus?
Quosve dabas gemitus, cum litora fervere lete
Prospiceree arce ex summa, totumque videres
Misceri ante oculos tantis clamoribus aequor?
Improbe amor, quid non mortalis pectora cogis!
Ire iterum in lachrymas, iterum tentare precando
Cogitur, et supplex animos submittere amori ς
Ne quid inexpertum, frustrs moritura, relinquat.
Anna, vides toto properari litore: circum
Undique convenere ι vocat jam carbasus aures,
Puppibus et laeti nautae imposuere coronas·

Hunc ego si potui tentum sperare dolorem—

Et perferre, soror, potero. Misera: hoc tamen unum
Exsequere, Anne, mihi: solem nam perfidus ille

Te colere, arcanos etiem tibi credere sensus ς

Sola viri molles editus et tempora notua.

NOTES.

⁴⁰⁵. Consecrant .· they carry osten. By
using this verb, the poet represents those
mimula· muching beckwsrd end forwerd‚
and returning frequently to their cells, suu
lsden with their booty, like soldier· resping
the spoils of ep enemy. Pars obnixe.- a.
put. shoving with their shoulders, push
along the large graina.

40⁶. Morus.- in the sense of morantes:
those that deity. Frequent allusione have
been made by poets of sll ages to the ente,
u exmplee of indum-y, wisdom, und sore-
sight. ‘⁸ Go to the unt, thou nluggard, con·
uider her ways, and be wise‚'' says Solomon.
uadem observationi hes not discovered in
them ιιι such iristsnces of industry. On
certain ἔαγε they carry out os their cells,
md expono to the wsrmth of the sun, their
‘83⁸³ but we find no storo of provisions
hid up against approaching went. For
during the cold senon of the year, they lie
m ι torpid state, end require no food.

⁴09. Fen-ere .· to be ell in s bustle-to be
buri} occupied.

mil: Improbe.- in the sense of candelis, vel
nou.

414. engfeur ire ieerum: she is forced
ugni„ to go into tesrs, again to try him by
:applicantium διο. As the poet had used
0⁰3¹} just before, so here he repests the seme

word, md shows the constreining power of serre, which must be supplied T

lore in Dido's conduct—she is forced, in
‘pite of hpr pride, her resentment. her reso-
lutione, end her imprecationn.

, Animos. Animus, in the plu. properly
'igniflua the affections or pas-iona of the
fund. The meaning os tlte passage is ι she
Ι forced again to have recourse to tem-s,
Ιῑιὶιι to try him with prayer-amm to submit
her pun-iona. ber resentment, her pride, end

ber indignat-ion, to love—to give up ⁸11 to
tho superior power end efficncy of her love.

415. Mor-itura srmtrd. commentator·
ere not agreed upon the meaning of the
word [καινὰ in this place. Servius con·
neets it with inexpertum. The, meaning
then will be: that she might not leavesny
thing unsttemptod‚ though in vsin3 since
she was resolved to die. But it is more like
s, lover ῑο entortsin some glitmnering hope
es long es the deur object· is within reach-
The better meaning is: lest b leuvin any
thing unetternpted.. or unu-iod, she should
disin vain--ahe should seem to throw away
her lise.

416. Proper-ari: there is ει hesterning, stir,
or bustle sround on the whole shore. 'rhi-
verb is used impersonelly.

riners heve placed garlanda on tio stem..
It was s. custom among ssjlors to deck the
stem· of the ship, both at suiling end land·
ing. 'rho reason for this was, that on the
uterus wne ι chnpel in honor of the gods
Peeoeci, who were considered the petrone
end protectore os the ship.

419. Si ego potui sperare, διο. Rursus
obscures this, snd the following line, by cou-
necting them closely together. It is plain
there is an ellipsis os the words homi dper-

is su den
end sbrupt transition is persectly agreeeble
to the temper os Dido's mind, end shows the
propriety os potero being in the sutum:
which otherwise cannot be justified ou any
principles of lmgusge.

4⁹21. Etr-sequere .- do—perform.

422. Colere .- in the senso of amare.

4⁴24. Hostem. This word sometimes we·
used by the encieuts in tho senso of hospe-
