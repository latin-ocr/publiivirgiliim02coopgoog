dom by the consent οἰ his brother Titan, on
the condition thet he should raise no male

not long romain mindful of this favor.
He conspired against him to dethrone him,
end possess the empire himself. Upon this,
Jupiter benished him stom heaven. He
cume to Italy, which wss esserwnrds called
Latium, from the circumstance cf its bemg
the place of his conceelmentz from the verb

him with hospitality, end made him pertner
in his kingdom. Suturn employed his time
in civilizing his subjecte, tenching them egri-
culture, end the several erts end sciences.
His reign wes so mild, so beneficent end
virtuous, thet it cume to be denominetcd the
Golden Age, to intimate the happiness end
tranquillity which then were enjoyed. The
Silver Age succeedod, when men began ῑο
degenerute, and their pesce ιο be disturbed .
by feuds und animosities. The Brasen Age
followed, when everice end licentiousness
took possession os the het-rt. Το this suc-
ceeded the Iron Age, when the world became
sunk into e general end total depravity.
These four eges ere much spoken of by the
poets, but particularly the first. By this
time men hed become so wicked und dege-
nerete, thet they were su destroyed by s
deluge, which took plece in the reign of
Deucalion, king of Thessaly. He und his
wife Pyrrhe were the only survivors.
