AENEIS.

LIB. 111. 243

This book contains the annals of seven years, and is replete with geographical and bis·
toria-al information. Nor is it wanting in fine specimens of poetry, and in interesting
incidente. The joy of AEneas at finding Helenus and Andromache on the throne of
Epirus-their happy mecting—their tendet and affectionate parting—the description of
Scylla and Charybdis, and the episode of the Cyclops, are all worthy of the poet.

In this book, virgil in a particular manner follows the Odyssey of Homer.

POSTQUAM res Asiae Priamique evertere gentem
immeritam visum Superis, ceciditque superbum
ilium, et omnis humo sumat Neptunia Troja ς

Diversa exilia, et desertas quaerere terras,
Auguriis agimur Divum: classemque sub ipsa 5

Incerti quo sata serant, ubi sistere detur;
vix prima inceperat aestas,

Contrahimusque viros.

NOTES.

1. Res Λεία .· the power et· Asia.

events w'ere not prosperous. The verb ese
is to be supplied with visunt.

3. Neptunus. Troy is here called Nep·
mucan, because Neptune, with Apollo, it is
uid, built its walls in the reign of Laome-
}1011- Homer and Virgil ascribe the build-
mg of the walls to Neptune alone. Ruaeus
takes Ilium to mean the citadel of Troy,
md distinguishes it from the whole town,
which ‘n here expressed by, munis Troja.
Homer uses Ilios, and Ovid, Ilion. ffimat.
The present here is much more expressive
than the past tense would have been:
nmokea to the ground.

4. Diverso .· in the sense of remota, or
lenginqua. Although the Trojans, under
different leaders, as AEneas, Helenus, and
Antenor, settled in different regions, yet
dtfma exilia plainly refers to AEneas and his
foues-ers only, who were all appointed to

7. Incerti quo. We may be somewhat
surprised to hear AEneas express any doubt
as to his course and intended seulement.
He had been distinctly informed by the
ghost os his wife, that Italy was the place
destined for him in the counsels os the gods:
he could not therefore have given full cre-
donce to the account: or the dangers and
difficulties os the undertaking might have
filled his mind with anxious and distrustful
apprehensione: or perhaps it is a passage,
which the author would have corrected, if
he had lived to revise his work.

8. Prima oestm. Scaliger thinks that
'rx-oy was taken about the suu moon, and
near the end of spring, and that AEneas set
out the beginning of summer. But it is
evident that it would require a greater
length os time to build a fleet, and make
other preparations for his long voyage. lf
he be correct in the time of the capture of
Troy, the prima oeseas, with more propriety,
will mean the beginning os the summer of
the following year. This better agrees with
history. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in-
forms us that he collected an army and sor·

ing it prudent to engage the enemy, he ca·
