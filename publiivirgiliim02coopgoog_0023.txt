1⁶. Hoc malum nobis. There seem to be

inanimata. We have introduced it into our

required here, to make the sense complete, language without any variation. Tenem
the words: and 1 might have understood ie ‚- soetm visiun, simply, eur lamba.

18. Sinistra cornu: .- the ill-bodtng ενοω.
The Romans were very superstitious. They
considered every thing as ominous. The
ssight of eome kinds os birds, th'e croakin
of others, the darting of a meteor, a pe
of thunder, were signs os good or bad luck.
These that appeared on their left hand, sor
the most part, they considered uniucky.
Hence sinister and levus came to signify
unlucky, ill-boding, 850. And those that ap-
peared on their right hand, they considered
to be lucky. Hence, dexter came to signify
fortunate, lucky, dcc. The best reason that
can be given, why they used &nister and
leemas, sometimes in a good, at other times
m a bad senae, is, that they occasionally
interpreted the omens after the manner of
the Greeks, who considered those that ap-
peared in the eastern part of the heavens to
be lucky; and turning their faces to the
north, as their custom was, they would be
seen on the right band. The Romans, on
the contrary, turned their faces to the south
in observing the omen-3 ai. consequently‚
their lest hand would be toward the east,

20. Romam. Rome, a city of Italy, situ·
ated on the river Tiber, founded by Romu·
tus 753 ears before Christ. Mantua war
a city ο the Cis-Alpina Gaul, now Lom-
bai-dy. situated on the eastern bank of the
river Mincius, which falls into the Po.

22. Fetus. 'This word significa the μονοις
of any thing or kind. whether animate or

23. Sia canibus, ke. This passage Ser-
vius thus explains: 1 thought before that
Rome resembled Mantua and other citiea,
as lknew whelps and kid· resemble tho-ir
dama or methora, differ-ing only in size. ln
this l was mistaken: 1 find it to be of a
different.species from other cities, as the
cypress differs from the shrub.

24. componere : in the senae oscampamre.

25. Extulit caput .· ham raised its head. A
figurative expression,butextremel y beautiful.

26 Vibarna, plu. os uibar-num, a species
of shrub. Some take it for α wally, others
for the wilti-vine.

28. Libertas. virgil here speaks of lum-
self as being an old man, having a hoary
beard, and as having been a slave. Nei-
ther of which was the ease. But it was not

too plain, and would have taken from the
beauty of the pastoral. [ner-tem .· indolent-
inactive. Sera .· late in life. .

29. Candidior barba .- my gray, or hoary
beard. The comp. is here plainly to be
taken in the sense ef the postndenti : to me
shaving it.

31. Amaryllis—Galatea. Some think these
are to be taken allegorically; the former sor
Rome, the latter for Mantua. But this is not
necessaryz nor will it be easy to support the
allegory throughout. It ia better to take
them literaliy. sor the names os the poet's
mistreases. Servius thinks nothing in the
Bucolica is to be taken allegorically. Dr.
Trapp thinks virgil insinuatos that his old
mistress Galatea was in favor οἷ Brutus,
and hia new one Amaryllis in favor of Au·
