AENEJS. Lm. lx.

Haud aliter Rutulo muros et caetra tuenti

[gnescunt iraez et duris dolor ossibus ardet'3
Qua tentet ratione aditus ; et qua via clausoe
Excutiat Teucros valle, atque effundat in oequor.
Classem, qum lateri castrorum adjuncta latebat,

Aggeribus septam circum et fluvialibus undis,

invadit3 sociosque incendia poscit ovantes,
Atque manum pinu flagranti fervidus implet.
Tum vero incumbunt: urget praesentia Turni,
Atque omnis facibus pubes accingitur atris.

Diripuere focos: piceum sert fumida lumen

'l'aeda‚ et commixtam Vulcanus ad astra favillam.
Quis Deua, ὁ Musae, tam saeva incendia Teucris

Avertit? tantos ratibus quis depulit ignes?

Dicite. Prisca fides factu, sed fama perennis,
Tempore, quo primum Phrygia formabat in Ida

67. Qua ratione.- in what way he may
obtain access3 and in what way he may
dislodge the Trojano, shut up in their in-
trenchments, διο. lt is much better to

the verb excutiat, with Heyne and Valpy.

in the sense of sacti, which makes the senso·
easier. The belief of thel fact was ancient„
but the report or tradition will always eone-
tinue. Davidson ren‘ders the words: θ an-
cient ie the testimony of the sset, but hn-

the tradition has been constant.”

80. Tempore.. quo, διο. By scine enties, ⁸
virgil hae been censured for this metamor-
