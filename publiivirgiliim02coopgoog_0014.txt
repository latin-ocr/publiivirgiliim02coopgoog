'mn mli: 01⁴* VIRGIL.

Puni-tus Vmeiuus Maso was born at a village called Andes, about three
miles from the city of Mantua, on the 15th day of October, iii the year of
Rome 684, and 70 years before the Christian era. Pompey the Great and
Marcus Licinius Crassus were consuls.

His parents were in humhle circumstances. His father cultivated a small
firm foi· the maintenance of his family. His mother, whose name was Maia,
vas related to Quintilius Varus, who rose to be proconsul of Syria, and after-
wards was appointed to the command of the Roman army in Get-many.

The first seven years of his life were passed under his paternal rooft after
which he was removed to Cremona, a town situated upon the banks of the Po,
and not far from Mantua. While here, he distinguished himself in those studies
suited to his age, and gave presage of his future eminence. In this pleasant
retreat he passed ten years, till he assumed the Toga virilis, which, among the
Romans, was at the age of 17. At an early period he sliowed himself to he ω
favorite of the Muses, and manifested a genius that one day was to rival the·
author of the lliad. At this time Pompey and Crassus were iii their second<

From Cremona he removed to Mediolanum, a town not far distant, and soon-
aster to Naples. Here he devoted his time to the study of the Greek language,⁴
os which he soon became master. By this means he was enabled to read the-
Greek poets in the original, to enter fully into their spirit, and to discover their:
heauties and excellencies. This proved of essential service to him in his future·
labors. With a mind thus stored with literature, and a taste formed by the besti
modelS, he entered upon the aeudy of medicine, mathematics, and philosophy„
These last, more especially, were his pleasure and delight, as he has intimamus
in several parts of his works.

He studied the Epicurean philosophy, then in much repnte, under one Sym,
an eminent toacher. He asterwards composed his Sixth Eclogue, with a view
to compliment liis preceptor, and to express a grateful remembrance of liis
instructions. Varus was a pupil with him at the same time. Hei-e they con-
tracted a friendship for each other, which continued during the remaindei· οἱ
their lives. Having finished his studies at Naples, which occupied severa}
years, it is said, he visited Rome3 but it is more probable that he returned tc·
Mantua, and retii-011, to his paternal inheritance. Here he acquired that piae·
tical information which so eminently qualitied him foi· writing the Georgica.

A person of Virgil’s extensive attainrnents, and above all, of his poetic genius,
