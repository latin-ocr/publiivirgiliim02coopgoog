&scripsit radio totum qui gentibus orbem?
Tempora quae messor, quae curvus arator haberet?

Nec quemquam fugio : tantum, vicine Palaemon,

NOTES.

who, &c- It is supposed that aratus or
Archimedes is meant. The former wrote in
Greek a treatise concerning the situation
and metiens of the heavenly bodies: which
was translated into Latin. The latter
was a famous' mathematician and ιειιοιιο-
mer of Syracuse, in Sicily. By the help of
hie burmn -glasses and engines, he nobly
defended t at city when besieged by the
Romans under Marcellus. After a siege of
three years, however, it was taken by stra-
tagem. Archimedes was slain by a soldier,
while in the act of demonstrating a propo-
sitien.

46. Orphea .· acc. of Greek endin .—
Orpheus was a most ancient and excel ent
poet, the son of OEagrus, king of Thrace.
But according to sable, he was the son os
Apollo and Caliope, one os the Muses. He
received a lyre from Apollo, some say from
Μ ercury, upon which he performed iu such a
masterly manner, that the rivers ceased to
, flow--thc savage beasts forgot their ferocity
—and tho losty oaks bowed their heads and
listened to his song. He was beloved by all
·the nympha. EurKdice alone could make
an impressioni on is mind. He married
herz but their happiness was short. For
Aristteus fell in love with herz and fleeing
from him, a serpent lying in the way
wounded her in the scot, os which she died.
Orpheus was so much afflicted at the loss,
that he resolved ιο recover her, or perish in
the attempt. For this purpose, he descend·
ed ιο Hell, and gained admittance to Pluto,
who was so charmed with his music, that
he consented ιο restore to him his wife, upon
the condition that he would forbcar to look
behind him till he passed the bounds of
his empire. The condition was acceptedz
but as they were very near the region of
light, the unhappy lover turned his eves ιο

..-

behold his long-lost Eurydice. He saw her,
but she immediately vanished away. He
attempted to follow her, but was refused.
The only consolation he could find, was in
the sound of his lyre in groves and moun·
tains spart from society. The Thracian
women, whom by his neglect and coldness
he had offended, eet upon him, while they
we're celebrating the orgies of Bacchus, and
having torn his body in pieces, they tlirew
his head into the river Hebrus, which con·
tinued to articulate Eurydice! Eurydice!
as it was carried down the stream into the
AEgean sea. After his death, some say, he
received divine honor-s. His lyre was trans-
ferred to the heavens, and made a constel-
lation. Sequenda.- obedient to his lyre.

-eondo, agreeing with poetata.

49. Nunquam effugiet hodie .· you shall by
no means avoid the trial this day. Damm-
tas had proposed ιο stake a heifer which
Menalcas said be could not do through sear
of his father and step-motherz but proposed
ιο pledge his bowls. Damoetas insisted upon
the heifer, and so seemed ιο avoid the con·-
test, because the conditions could not bs·
accepted by Menalcas. At length, however,
confident of victory, and laying aeide his
fear, he says: Veniam quecunque vocaris τ
1 will come ιο any conditions you shall pro-
pose. Accordingly the bowls are laid asida,
and a heifer is the prise.

50. Tamum vd qm· venit, ᾱο. Only (1 have
nothing more to say) even let him who
comes yonder, hear these things. Menalcas
was ao sure of victory, that he was willing
to submit to the decision os any third per-
sona and accordingly seeing some person
at a distance, says: even lot him, who is
coming there, be the judge of our contro·
versy, whoever he may be. Upon his near
approach, dincovering who he was, he says,
behold, it is Paloemon our neighbor. Voce .·
in the sense os cunm.

51. Fg'ffieiam: l will cause.

53. Fugio: in tht· sense ol' termo.
