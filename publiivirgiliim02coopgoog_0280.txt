Ut me conspexit venientem, et Troia circum
Arma amens vidit3 magnis exterrita monstris,
Diriguit visu in medio: calor ossa reliquit:

habitum et longo vix tandem tempore satur:
Verane te facies», verus mihi nuntius affers ³
Nate Det? vivisne? aut, si lu alma recessit,

Hector ubi eet? Dixit: lachr3 nuque effudit, et omnem
implevit clamore locum. Vix patina sumna
subjicio, et raris turbatus vocibus hisco:

Vivo equidem, vitamque extrema per omnia duce.

Ne dubita, ham vera vides.

Heu! quis te caspii dejectam conjuge tanto ,
Excipit? aut quae digna satis fortuna revisit?
Hectoris Andromache, Pyrrhiu’ connubia servas?

Others, however, thmk she erected (conse-
emed) both to Hector, it being customary
to erect two alteru ιο the Mena, especially
ef Hei-oea, who were considered inferior

muse, or incentive to her tearu. They
brought mure sorcibly to her mind the re-
eouection of her husband, and renewed her
former grief.
