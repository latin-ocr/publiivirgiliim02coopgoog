AENEIS. LIB. XL·

Disiectique duces, desolatique manipli

Tuta petunt, et equis aversi ad moenia tendunt

870
8¹11. 'ruta lece

Nec quisquam instantes Teucros, letumque serentes
Sustentare valet telis, aut sistere contra:

Sed laxos referunt humeris languentibus arcus,

874

Quadrupedumque putrem cursu quatit ungula campum.

Volvitur ad muros caligine turbidus atra
Pulvis: et e speculis percussae pectora matres·
Foemineum clamorem ad coeli sidera tollunt.

877. Matres percussa
quoad

Qui cursu portas primi irrupere patentes,

Hos inimica super mixto premit agmine turba.
Nec miseram effugiunt mortem ς sed limine in ipso,
Moenibus in patriis, atque inter tuta domorum
Confixi, exspirant animas. Pars claudere portas:
Nec sociis aperire viam, nec moenibus audent
Accipere orantes: oriturque miserrima credes
Defendentfim armis aditus, inque arma ruentum.
Exclusi, ante oculos lachrymantssmque ota parentum,
Pars in precipites fossas, urgente ruine,

Volvitur; immissis pars caeca et concita sraenis
Arietat in portae, et duros objice postes.

Ipsae de muris summo cfirtamine matres
(Monstrat amor verus patriae) ut videre Camillam,

NOTES.

frtri .· the point of the arrew was tipped
with iren, or s’teel, to make it enter the object
more easily.

870. Μαπὶρὶἰ. The manipulus was pro-
perly the standard bearet, so called from a
bundle of hay ticd to the end of a pole,
which the first Romans used instead of an
ensign. It was asterwards used for the com·
panies, οι· bande os soldiers, to which a ma·
m'pulus was attached: also, for troops in
general, by meton. Desolali: deserted by
their officere—lest alone. Diq'ecti: scattered
thread—elain. Ruoeus says, dissipati.

8¹11. Averni .· in the sense of conversi.
873. Sustentare .· to stop—to resist.

876. Pulvis turbidus, διο. The meaning
is, that dust rising in clouds of thick dark-
ness approaehes the city. This was a pre-
sage of defeat to the Latina, and filled φο
metrone with dismay and consternation.
During the engagement they had been spec·
tators of the conflict. ·

877. Jeculis .· in the sense of muria

880. ies-te agruim. This may refer either
to the Trojans or Latina. If it refer to the
former, it will imply that they mingled with
the Latine, aud slew thern without regard to
the order of attach: if it refer to the latter,
it will imply that they flod in confusion and
disercior, and in that state were pursued by
the enemy. lt appears that some of the
soremost ot‘ the pursuers entered the gates
along with the Latina, and continued the

work os death within the walls, and among

the very houses os the city. ,
886. Defendenfflm: of tirose who hy force

of arms oppose the entrance of the flying

troops, and of those, who wish to force an

entrance to save themselves from the hands

os the enemy.

888. Pracipites .· ὴωάῙοης-φιίοΙι--υυ-
expected, denoting the manner ot‘ their fall.
It win agree with pars, ss a noun of inulti-
tude. Fessus.- these were the large heles,
or pits, which the Latina dug before tho
gates, to impede the approach os the enemy.
See 478. supra.

889. Frenis immissis .- st suu speed-the

· reins being given to the horses. Ceste .- thie

implies that they had lost their presence oi
mind, and knew not what they were doing.
Concita : in the sense ot* celeris.

890. Dares objice .· strengthened-made
strong—secured by bars.

891. Summe certamine : with the greatest
scal, or earnestness. Huyne says, extreme
certamine. ,

892. Ut videre .- as they saw Camilla.
Heyne says, exemplo Gemilloe. They had
been spectatore of the battle, and behcld her
noble deeds of valor3 and how much patri-
otism and love os country were displayed in
all her actions. Prompted by her example,
they now arm themselves in haste, and ro· ’
pair to the place of danger, reaely to die in
their country's causo.
