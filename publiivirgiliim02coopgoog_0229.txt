NOTES. ’

the nom. agreeing with nos, meaning the
Trojans. But this is not ao easy and natu-
rai ; nor does it so well agree with the sub·
ject. The poet uniformly represents Sinon
affissffizi‘gssd‘ss's‘zissssbrssl '‘i‘'sss'rssiss
strongly insi-ts upon coactis. Valpy reads
eoacti. Heyne, coactis.

197. Larissam.- an adj. from Larissa, a
town os Thessaly, near Phthia. the place
where Achilles was born.

198. Mille car-inm. Homer makes 1186
ships in all, that went in the Trojan expedi-
tion. Carina, the keel, put, by synec. for
the whole ship. The poets often use a de-
finite number for an indefinite, particularly
if the number be very large.

199. Hie aliud .· here another greater pro-
digy, and one much more to be dreaded, is
presented to our sight, nobis miseris.

200. Improvida .· improvident-—not ex-
pecting any thing of the kind. Pectora .· in
the nense of animos.

201. Laocoon. The priest of Neptune
having been put to death, because, by his
prayers and sacrifices, he did not prevent
the arrival os the Greeks, Laocoon was

chonen by lot to sacrifice to that god upon ‚

the departure of their enemiea. He was
the priest of Apollo Tlmmbraeus. Some say
he was the brother of Anchisen others that
he was the son of Priam.

Hyginus, who relates the story, say· the
crime for which Laocoon was thus severely
punished, was his having married, and had
children, contrary to the orders of Apollo:
and that the Trojano construed this calamity,
which besel him, as an aet of vcngeance of
the gods sor his having violatcd the offe-ring
of Minerva. virgil, therefore, Judiciously
introduces this event, not only as it is a fine
unbenisbment of his poem3 but also as it

gives the probabiliz
of the wooden horse, and
eredulity os the Trojano.

202. Solennet oras.- the

503. Tenedo. Tenedos i
to signisy, as Servius say
were to come from hence 1
of Troy. Per tranqmm

—crests. Salo: in the se
