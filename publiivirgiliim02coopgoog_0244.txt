poet here gives us a very lively idea of the

spreading desolation and destruction every
where in its course. Cumulo.- auctu uqua-

501. Hecubam. She was the wife os Pri·
mand daughter of Cisseus, king of Thrace.
She was carried into slavery by the Greeks.
Gemma nurus. Homer informs us that Priam
lud only fifty sons, Iliad vi. He could not
therefore have a hundred daughters-indam
unless we suppose each one to have had tivo
wives. This might have been the οπως but
there is no mention made of it. To explain
this difficulty, some take the definite num-
ber conum. ser an indefinite one. Others,

He had therefore sixty-two children by hi·
several wives, nineteen of whom, Hecuba
bore him. The rest he had by his other

wives. All these bed-chambers ware in
Priam's palace.

504. Superbi barbarice eure .· decos-atad
