516. Ec amor revulsus: und the love (of
the mare) torn from the forchend of a newly
souled coit. The poet here means what is
ctllcd tho kip amane-r,- of which there are
two kinds. ee Geor. iii. 280. et sequens.
The one here meant ie very different from
the one there described. According to the
account given of it by the encients, it wne

ncripiion iu a most beautiful, and, at the

Trapp objectu to it ae imperfect. But it is
ω be obser-ved that the poet did not deeign

it u ι dencription of night in generelg but
only of a. calm und serene one, in order thot
he might eet off to greater advantage the
opposite image of Dido'e mxiety and dis-
quietude. And indeed nothing could give

than thus to eet it forth ‚in opponition to the
universal quiet and repone which rei ed
