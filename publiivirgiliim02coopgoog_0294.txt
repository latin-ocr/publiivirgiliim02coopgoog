Audimus longe, stactaeque ad litore voces;
Exultantque vada, atque aestu miscentur arenoe.

Et pater Anchises: Nimirum hoec illa Charybdis:
Hos Helenus scopulos, hoec saxa horrenda canebat.

Eripite, ὁ socii, pariterque insurgite remis.

Haud minus ac jussi faciunt: primusque rudentem
Contorsit laevas proram Palinurus ad undas:
Laevsm cuncta cohors remis ventisque petivit.
Tollimur in coelum curvato gurgite, et idem
Subducta ad Manes imos descendimus undu.

562 Palinurus primus .- pannum. first

Some read rudente, for rudentem, a sub. in·
stead os the part- By this they would un-
derstand e rope fastened to the side of the

568. Verum cum sole. These eircum-
stances heve a happy effect in preparing the
reader for the following description of niount
AEtna. The winde are hushed, that the
bellowings of the mountain might be ruore
distinctly heardz and night is brought on
that in the dusky sky the flames might up-
pear more conspicuous.

were the first inhabitants of Sicily, especial-
ly about mount -AEtmu They ere said ιο
have been of gigantic stature, and os a na-
ture savuge, cruel, und inhospituble. Hence
the poets took occasion to represent them
of a monstrous form, having only one eye,
and thatin their forehead, and as being cun·
nibals. From their vieinity to AEtns, it is
said, they were employed by Vulcan in
forging the thunderbolts os Jupiter.

The port, where :Encas lauded, was near
the place where the city Catanen now stands,
near the foot of mount AEtna. The Cyclope
were supposed to be the sons os leus and
Terra. They took their name from the
circumstance os their having but one eye.
This tradition originated froin their custom
of their wearing sniall bucklers os steel,
which covered their faces. These hud a
small aperture in the middle, which cor-
responded etsctly to the eye. They were
reckoned among the gods,and had a temple
dedicated to them at Corinth. AEtna is
now called mount Gibel, and stands not sar
from the eastern shore of Sicily. 11· medem
name implies, the mount of mounts.

570. lugan.- in the senso of cepae.
