Quidve sequens, tantos possim supemre‘laboreat
Hic Helenus, caesis primum de more juvencis,

Exorat pacem Divum, vittasque resolvit

Sacrati capitio, meque ad tuu limine, Phoebe,
lpse manu multo suspensum numine ducit:
Atque haec deinde canit divino ex ore sacerdos:
Nate De& nam te majoribus ire per ultum
Auspiciis manifesta fides ε eie fatu Deiim rex

Pauca tibi ὁ multia, quo tutior hospite lustro·

37⁰. Resolvit vitiae .· the priest in per-
fer-ming sacrifice, had his head bound about
with fillete: now he is about to prophesy,
he unbinde, end takes them from hie head.
Pacem : favor ce.

3'1’ 2. Suspensum .· in the sense os solicitum,
vel trepidantem. Multo nwnine: et thy ew-
ful majesty—thy mighty power. Ruoeus
251¹, ob ‚ananam reverentiam Dei.

Some copies have turpem, which means ·
thet Hele-nm ves full of anxiety, perturbe-
tion‚ and οπο, from the power or influence
of the god. But sus nsum ie the better
reading, referring to neae, who had good
reason to be in awful suspense end anxiety
about his future fortune, which the god wne
{ibim to declere to him by the mouth of

e enus.

³73. Cani! .· in the nenne of eloquitur.

874. Majoribmawpieiis: moy meon, with
dte greater auspices, signs, or manifestatione.
Among the various omen· or signe, which
were thought to give ineight into futur-ity,
rome were considered more important than
othere. Of thece were visione, eppeurunces
in the heavene, &c- which ull along hed uc-
oompenied AEneen. But auspicium eignifiee
any event or fortune. If this be the meen-
ing here, which most probably ie the cese,
then majoribus auspiciis wiu be, for greater
or more important evento—for better for·
tune—sor moro prosperum deye. 'rhi- ie
the opinion of Heyne.

375. Sic re: Dei'am .· thu· the king of the
gode dispenses hie deenen, end fixes (volvit,
rous) the eei-ie· of eventu: thi- order (or
course of things) ie fixed.

lt ἰι plain the poet heth here in view the
sabulum story of the Parcoe, who were
thought to preside over the evento of humen
lise: und to order. or fix, whatever befell to

of con-ulting the oncle, which νυ eome-
time· done b cuting or drawing lotus or·-
dinae, ιιι e cyno·

377. oepita: un edj. intervening. ltu-
σοι interprete it by, quoe excipient te.- which
tholi receive you.

It ie plain thet the aean over which he πυ
to pm, were those that intervertat, or lay
between Epirus, end that part of Italy te
which he was bound. These would be the
Ionian eea, lying between Epirus end the
extremity of the peninum„ thet part of the
Mediterraneum lying to the east und south
of Sici] ς und the 'sta-scau sea, lying between
Sicily, tuly, und the inlunds of Sardinia und
Corsica. Lustra.- in the senae of naviges.
vapr takes hospita, in the sense of ignota .-
to which he wne ι ntrmiger.

379. Pareoe prohibent .· the feteo forbid
thet you should know the rest. Pierius ob-
serves, ‘thot in most of the ancient copie·
there ie a full stop ester seire.- Servius ep-
provee of it, und it appears the beet. 'rue
nense is uanior, und we avoid any incon-
eistcncy. 11· we make both the verbe, prohi-
bent und velat, refer to Helenus, there will
be un inconsistency. For, would Juno forbid
him to declure what he did not know him·
aelf? Beeidee‚he hed Just nid that he would
only inform him of a few of the evento thet
were to befell him; which certainly implien
that he knew the rent, but was restrained by
heaven from communiceting them to him.
Some of thece eventu it wee not proper for
him to know3 because the accompushment
depended on hie own free will. Other·
June prevented him from reveeling‚ that he
mi ht be the more perplexed with doubt·
ιη uncertaintyz and the more surprised
und unprovided against the culumity when
it cume. of thie kind is the interpretation
of Celoeno’e prophecy, which Helenus ap
poure to heve understood: for he forbid·
him to be much concerned about it, for tho
gode would find ι wey to extricute him from
it: verse 394. infra.

Another particular is the death of Aa.
