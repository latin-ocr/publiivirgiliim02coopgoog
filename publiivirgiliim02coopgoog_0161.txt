extinction (morti) or loss of existence: thet
all, volare viva, fly alive into the order of his
star, and take their station in high heaven.
In other words, ull transmigrete into other
beings in a perpetual round. This notion
was held by many distinguished philoso-
phers of the heathen world. But it was ftu-
from the tru th. All irretionsl enimals perish
st their death. Man alone is immortal.
When unassistcd reason is employed upon
the subject of u future stete of existence, it
discovers its own weakness. The research-
es of philosophy serve only to bewilder the
mind. All correct information upon thst
subject must come through tho medium of
divine revelation. Pythagoras and his fol-
lowers strennuusly maintained this doctrine.
The Epicurisns maintained the doctrine of
s. menum, and the atomio theory.

228. Si quando, dte. The poet now pro·
eeeds to mention the proper sessons for open-
ing the hives. He gives directions how to
proceed in the business, end notices the ραι--ο
sionnte temper of the bees upon such occa.-
siens.

Aug-ustam. This is the reading of the best
editions, and is supported by ancient manu·
scripte. Ruoeus, Devidson, anpy,snd some
others, have angustam. But if the poet in·
teuded to inform us that the hive wss small,
hs might have saved himself the pains.
Resides, angustam is, by no means, sn im-
proper epithet. Itis exacta in the spirit of
poetry. lt is well known st the hee-hive

This, however, is not without objections.

tu, the passage would be ensier3 then sm
would be preferable to era. But whatever
difficulties may attend the construction, the
meaning is obvious. Heyne tslzes Fene ors
haustu aquarum, in the sense of, tene vel een·
tine harusam ore.

Devidson reads haustus, end ore.

230. Firmos.- it is customary, st tho pre-
sent day, to drive or force the bees from tin
hive with smoke.
