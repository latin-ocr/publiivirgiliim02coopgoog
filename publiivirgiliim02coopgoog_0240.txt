NOTES.

eusky ni ht, &e- they also appear. Menti-
ts tela.- lse or fictitious armour. lt pur·

that those who wore it were Greeks3
but in emm were Trojans.

⁴23. Sigriane ore .- they observo our words
mering in sound from theirs. We speak
not their language, and, therefore, they know
there must be some deception in the busi-
nen. Some understand by sene, the Gre-
eian watch-word. Ora.- in the sense of
rerba, by meten.

424. Πίσα obruimur.- instantly we are
ererpowered by numbers. 'rho word ilicet
was anciently used in the sense of actum est :
211 is over. lt was an expression used by
the jndge, who, when he thought fit to put
aa end to business, ordered the crier to pro·
nonnos ilicet, i. e. ire licet .· all may go--the
business is over.

425. armipotentis Divoe: the warlike god-
dess—Pallas. See Geor. i. 18. Penelei.-
Peneleus was one os the five generals of the
Beotians who came to the Trojan war.

428. V {sum aliter Dis. Having mention-
ed that his friend was the most just, and
most observant of justice among the Tro·
jans, AEneas certainly could not mean that
it seemed otherwise to the gods. Something
it is uident must be understood. Now, the
mention of this excellent man, would natu-
rally suggest the reflection that he desei-ved
a better end: he ought not to have fallen
with the rest: but he checks himself: Dis
aliter vz‘mm: it seemed otherwise to the
gods. Commentators have been much di-
vided in opinion upon these words. But in
this view they are plain and intelligible.
'rho verb est is understood.

429. Nee ma plurima pietas.- nor did thy
geatfpiety? riilor the fillets of Apollo, protect

ee rom a tn .

431. Iliaci άξενω .· ye Trojan ashes, and
the last flames of my country, l cell you to
witness, that, διο. Vires. By this Servius
understands pugnes, fights3 because they
fought by courses. Scaliger takes it to
mean wounds and deadly blows, vulnera et
eoedm because wounds in fighting are mu·
tually given and received. Donatus con i-
dere it an allusion to the gladiatore: t e
verb vito, joined with it, being a term used
in fencing to parry off a thrust, in opposition
to pete, to aim one. For vices, Ruoeus says
per-icida. Heyne says casus pugna.

433. Fuissen! .· in the sense of :inuicte-nt.

434. Meruisse manu : thatl merited it by
this right hand. i. e. by fighting. There is
something noble in this sentiment. lt con·
siders death as a prize or reward, which the
valiant win by their merit or valor. This
agrees with his former reflection: pulchrum
que meri succurrit in armis. Divellimur in-
de Iphitus, ee .- we are torn away from thence.
He speaks of it as a great affiiction; and.
as it were, accuses his fate that eenied him
the honor of so glorians a death.

4:35. Gravior ωηο.- iphitus was now op·
pressed or enfeebled with ages and Pelias
disabled by a wound which he had received
from Ulysses. AEve: for anna.

437. Preeimis .· immediately—in haste
Vocati .· summ is understood. ·

438. Ceu.- in the sense of qimai. it is
understood before nulli. Bella .· in the sense
os oe.

‘afflator-tem indo-nima.- Μαι-ι, furiens„
ungoverned. Mars, the god of war, put for
