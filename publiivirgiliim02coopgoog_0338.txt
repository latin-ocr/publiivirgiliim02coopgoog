AENEIS. Lm. V

ipse gubernator puppi Palinurus ab altu:

lieu! quianam tanti cinxerunt oethera nimbi 2
Quidve, pater Neptune, peres? sic deinde locutus,
Colligere arma jubet, validisque incumbere rem-'n3
Obliquetque ninus in ventum, ac teliu futur:
hhgnenime AEnea, non, si mihi Jupiter auctor
spondent, hoc sperem ltaliam contingere coelo.
Mutati transverse fiemunt, et vespere ab etro
Consurgunt venti ε etque in nubem cogitur aer.
Nec nos obniti contre, nec tendere tantum
sufficimus ι superat quoniam fortuna, sequamur:
Quoque vocat, vertamus iter. Nec litora longe
Fida reor fraterna Erycis, portusque Sicanos,

Si modo rite memor servata remetior astra.

Tum pius AEneas: Equidem sic poscere ventos
Jamdudum, et sruetre cerno te tendere contria.
Flecte viam velie. An sit mihi gratior ulla,
Quoque magis sesne optem demittere nave33
Quum quae Dardanium tellus mihi servat Acesten,
