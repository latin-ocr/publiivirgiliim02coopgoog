Tam-mo matu. The form of a buli in of-
ten, by tho poeta, given to rivere, from their
roaring and rapid course: the noiee which
they make, bearing nome resemblance to
the bellowmg of that animal. They are also
called cornuti, or berned, from the double
bank· or channela, into which they divide

themelae: οι· perhaps from the circum-.

atance os their being sometimes formed by
the union of two aueame or enialler rivere.
A„ sor example, the river Ohio i· formed
by tho union of the river· Allegbany and
Monongahela.

Herculeo is naid to have broken off one
of the horne of Achelous. lt is thus ex-
plained. That hero reduced the river to one
chamuel or atroam. The dried part or bro-
ken born os the river was converted into
stuitful nond· and gurdone. Thia gave riae
to the {able of the cornucopie‚ or born of
plenty. This wau given to the nymphe, and
by thern presented to the Goddese os plenty.
