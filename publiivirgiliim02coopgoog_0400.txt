Some make it to bo this : unde magna ars

interpretation is founded on what we are told
by Pliny. that‘the Po, soon aster its rise,
passos under ground and flows out again in
s part of P iedmont. Others: avide magnus
Eridanus stuic ad superiores incolas terroe.
'rhi- scems to be t'he opinion of Ruoeus. This
appears to be founded upon the general re·
ceived opinion that the great source of rivers
is in the body of the earth. Mr. Davidson
differs from both of these interpretatione.

tion. denoting from an eminence or rising

667. Maurum· Musaeus was the disciple
of Orpheus. He was an Athenian by birth,
and flourished under Cecrops the second, ιι
considerable time before the destruction of
Troy. He was sn heroic poet. There are
said to be some fragments of verses which
go under his name, but probably they arn
the production of a later poet. Some have
censured Virgil for preferring Mun-au to
Homer as a poet. But it is to be remem-
bered that Homer did not live till some time
after this descent of AEneu, and therefore
to have mentioned him, would have been
wholly out of place.
