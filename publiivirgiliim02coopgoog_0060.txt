Damonis Musam dicemus et Alphesiboei.
Tu mihi, seu niagni superas jam saxa Timavi3
Sive oram lllyrici legis aequoris : en erit unquam
Ille dies, mihi cum liceat tua dicere sacta 2
En erit, ut liceat totum mihi ferre pe» orbem
Sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna cothurno!
A te principium ε tihi desinet : accipe jussis
Carmina coepta tuis, atque hanc sine tempora circum
Inter victrices hederam tibi serpere lauros.
Frigida vix coelo noctis decesserat umbra,
Cfim ros in tenera pecori gratissimus herba esti
incumbens tereti Damon sic coepit olivae.

Da. Nascere, proeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, al-
Conjugis indigno Nisae deceptus amore
Dum queror, et divos (quanquam nil testibus illis
Proseci) extrema moriens tamen alloquor hora.

NOTES.

b. Dicemus .· in the sense os narrabimus.

Β. Tu nihi, &c- lt is generally thought
that the poet addresses himself ιο Pollio,
vhe, about this time, returned ιο Rome in
triumph, having overcome the Partheni, a
people os Illyric-mn. 'l'he verb save, or adeo.
must be supplied. ιο malie the sense com-
plete. Ellipses of this kind are frequent,
particularly among the poeta. (limavi.
See AEn. i. 244.

7. Sive legis, διο. whether you coast
along the shore of tho lllyrian ses. lllyri-
eum was a very extensive country lying on
the right of the Adriatic sea.. or gulf of
Venice, including the ancient Liburnia and
Delmatia. AEquoru. AEquor properly sig-
nifies any plain or level sur-face, whether
land or water. Eric .· ιιι the sense of ader-il.

10. cothurno. The cothurnus was pro-
perly s high-hesled ahoe, worn by the tra·
gedians to make thern appear taller; by
meten. put for tragedy, or the tragic style.
Sophocleo .· an adj. from Sophocles, an Athe-
nian, the prince of tragic poetry. He was
cotemporary with Pericles. Tuo earmina
nola. διο. Your verses alone worthy os the
buskin—worthy of being introduced upon
the stage. The cothurnus is here called
Sophoclem, becaum Sophocles introduced
tt upon the stage. Pollio was not only a
state-man, but a poet, and a distinguished
writer os tragedy. See Eel. iv, 12.

11. Principiunnsm. This lineis elliptical.
The ellipsis is supplied in the ordo: the he-

‘nning σι’ my labors was from these my
ebora shall end with thee. From this
circumstance, some have been led to think
that the poet alludes to Augustus, and not
ιο Pollio. He wrote his first Edogue, it is
true. to compliment the generosity os his

“ ee, and the AEneid to flatter his vanity.
fflwe are to remember, it was through the
interest and friendship of Pollio, that he re-

covered his landa, and so had an occasion
given him sor writinffi3 and further, that
poets promise many inge, which they ‹lo
not perform. ,

12. Sine hanc. dte. Permit this ivy ιο
creep around th'y temples unidst thy vie·
torious laureis—permit me to crown theu
with iv , while others crown thee with lau·
rel.
poet here entreats his patron to permit his
ivy ιο entwine about his temples among his
victorious laurels; in other words, to accept
these his verses, in the midst of his vic-
tories. The poer³e crown was originallye
made of ivy exclusis-ely, asterwards. some·
times it was made οι· laureiz but the tri-
umphal crown was always made of laurei.
Victrices lauros: alluding to the triumph
with which he was honored sor his victory
over the Partheni.

16. Ter-eei olivo· .· leaning againsta upa.
ing olive, Damon thus began.

17. Proevmiem. The parts of the verb
are separated for the sake of the verse, by
Tmesis. This figure isofrequent among the

sun: Hesperus, when following aster him.
There is a fitness and propriety in Damon's
calling upon the star, or planet Venus ιο
ariae, as if ιο listen to his complaint, since
it was a love affair. Age.- in the sense of
advehe.

18. Coujugis. conjux here is a betrothed
or expected wife. Indigno amore.- may
mean immoderate levoz or a love ill-requi·

tod—-e love os which N isa was unworthy.

20. Prqseei .· Ι have gained, or profited
nothing. Illis testibus. lt would seem that
Nisa had pledged her raith to Damon, nd
called the gods to witness it; yet she vio·
