. NOTES.

21. Maenalios versun Menalcan, or pas-
toral verses-such as used to be sung on
mount Maenalus in Arcadia. It was sacred
to Pan. By reason os its pleasant grows,
and whispering pines, it was much frequent·
ed by :thephei-ds, where they sang their
loves. The poet personifies the mountain,
and makes it listen to the songs of shep-
herda.

22 Loquenses .· whispering-tunesul.

24. Qui primus.- who first, διο. See Eel.
ii. 31. [uerter .· in the sense of inutiles.

27. Grypha: griffons. They were fa·
buleus animala, having the body of a lion,
and the wings and beak of an engle.

28. Demo. cimai .- the timid deer. Ad
{ocula .- m tne sense of ad aquam, vel potum:

meton.

129. lucide seces. It was a custom among
the Romans to lead the bride to the house
of her husband with lighted torches before
her. These torches were pieces of pins, or
tome unctuous wood, which were cut to a
point, that they might be lighted the easier.
It was usual to have five os these torches.
Hence ducem uxorem, carne to signisy‚ to
marry a wissa it is said of the husband: nu-
bere viro, to marry a husband3 this is said
of the wife.

30. Sparge nuces.- scatter nuts. It was
a custom among the Romans st nuptials,
for the husband to throw nuta, διο. upon the
fluor, that the boys and the rest os the com-

evening star is leaving Oeta for you. Oeta
was a mountain, or rather range of moun-
uina, of great height, in Thessaly. The in-
habitants of Attica and Beotia being to the

eastward‚ would obser-ve the stare retii-ing
or settling behind it. Hence, as it respected
them, the expression is the same as saying,
the evening star is setting. and consequentl
the evening somewhat advancedz whic
would not be an unpleasant circumstance
to the new-married couple.

34. Hirsutum m ereilium: my mogh, or
shaggy eyebrows. ξ’
of complaint inst ,msa sor not leving
these, and his ong beard. These surely
possess no charms. But as Dr. Trapp ob
serves, the ground of his complaint lay in
this: that her cruelty and scorn had so dis-
heartened him, as to render him negligent of
his outward appearance.

35. Mortalia: thing-s done by morula.
This line is both beautiful and pathetic.

his falling in love with her at the same
time, are so well chonen, and happily ex-
pressed, that we may consider this passage
as one of those happy and delicate touches
which characterize the writings os virgil.
