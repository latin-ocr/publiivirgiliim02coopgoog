w so much affected, that she lhinted away} and Augustus⁰was so highly
pleased with the compliment paid. to his nephew, that he ordered ten eata-tia
to he given for every line of the eulogium. This amounted to a very large sum.
The verse 165, had been leti in an unfinished state, and in the heat of fancy,
occasioned by the recital, it is said, the poet added the words, mumque οσ-
enda-e ωηεν, which complete the measure.

ln four years afterwards, he finished the remaining six books, so that the poet
spent eleven years in writing the AEneid. At this time, he was in the fisty·
first year of his age, and his health considerably impeired. He had revised the
Eclogues and the Georgica, and continued to improve them till the year before
nis death, aa appears from some passages, particularly the closing verses of the
laet Georgic. Augustus was on the banks os the Euphrates, in the year ot
Rome 734. At this time virgil was fisty years of age, and the Georgica had
been published ten years.

lt was the intention of Virgil to revise the AEneid also, before it was publish-
ed. And for this end he visited the classic soil of Greece, where he purposed
to devote three years to the poem: and, this being done, to turn his attention
to philosophy. This, from his earliest years, had been his derling study, as he
mforms us in the latter part os the second Georgi03 and he ishad to spond the
remaining years of his life in contemplating the works of nature, and in ele-
vating his mind to ite divine Author.

But soon aster his arrival, his health became so delicate, and his stmnguu so
much exluusted, that he was obliged to relinquish it3 and Augustus being on
his return from Asia, Vir-gil thought proper to accompany him. At Megara,
a town not far from Athens, he became seriously indisposed, and apprehensione
were entertained of his recovery. He liastened his return to Italy, but con·
tinued to decline, and a few days aster his arrival at Brundusium, a town in the
eastern part of Italy, he expired, on the 22d day of September, being nearly
51 years of age. He died with, that composure and resignation, which be·
came so good and virtuous a man. He wished to be interred at Naples, the
fivorite place of his residence; and Augustus ordered his body to be removed
thither, according to his desire3 where it was buried with every testimony of
respect and esoeenn Just before his death, he wrote the following lines, aa hi·
