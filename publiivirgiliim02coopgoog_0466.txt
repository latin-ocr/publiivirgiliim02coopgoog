NOTE Β.

mgbt. Rest is here said to expel eleep, be-
cause, when we have taken rest, sleep be·
eomes unnecessary’. Curriculo .· circle-
course. Ruoeus says, spatio.

4⁰9. Tenui Minerva. This may mean
handycrast in general, or spinstry in parti·
eular. Or, perhaps, it is better to under-
stand it of the werke of the loom.

410. &macae impositum, διο. virgil bere
connects the same verb with two substan-
tivee, when it ean properly be used with one
of them only. This is frequent with him,
and is a beauty which our language will not
admit. Cinerem impositum is, doubtless, the
ashes that cover the fire, which she first re·
mov-³⁸3 and then she kiudles or awakes the
dormant tire (sopitos ignes) into a flame-
See ΕΒ. vii. 431.

411. Addam noctem .- adding the night to
her work—working in the night, before the
approach of day.

412. casaeum: chaste—undcfiled. Here
the poet gives us a fine description of do-
mestic industry, on the part of the mistress
of the house.

414. Ignipotens.- aname of Vulcan. Nee
segnior : nor less active--induscriouae than she.

415. Ad fabrilia opera: to his mechanie
labor*- ο

416. Insula erzgitur, ὥσ. Between Sicily
and the Italian coast there are seven islanda,
called AEozffloe, from AEolus, who reigned
thei-03 and V alcanica, from Vulcanus, whose
sorge was sabled to have been in one of them.
Thia is imitated from Homer. He, how-
ever, places Vulcan's forge in heaven; Vir-
gil, with more propriety, places it on the

earth. As the eruptione of AEtna are mat-
ters of fact, the poet, with much judgment,
places the forge of the Cyclops in the neigh-
borhood of that mountain. The whole de·
scription ie os the noblest kind. Brontes,
Steropes, and Pyracmon, were his principa!
assistente. All os Greek derivationi.

418. Exere.- excavated—hollowed out by
the forge· of the Cyclops.

421. Strictum .· bars of iren or steel.
Chalybum. The Chalybes were a people of
Spain; or, according to some, of Pontus,
celebrated for their iron werke. Here, by
meten. put for iren and steel.

426. lusor-matum.- unfinished. A part only
was polished, the rest remaining in an im-
perfect state.

429. Tres radios torti imbris. By the :oren
imbris, the wreathed shower, commentator·
understand hail. The terei expresses the
violence with which hail in a stoi-iu is hurled
or darted. Rodios. These are the forks or
spikes with which lightning is painted or
described. The form ot· thunder, to which
virgil here seems to allude, is known from
medalu. It consisted of twelve wreathed
spikes or dart-s, extended like the radii of a
circle, three and three together, with wings
spread out in the middle. The wings de-

note the lightning’s rapid motion, and the ,

spikee or darts, its penetrating quality. By
the four different kinds of spikee, Servius
understande the four seasons of the year.
According to him, the tter imbris torti ra-
dies, or the three spikes os hail, denote the
winter sea-son, when hail-storius abeund.
