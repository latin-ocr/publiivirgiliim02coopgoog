NOTES .

290. Moliri.- to hund-40 luy the foun-
dations os their houeee. The word Trojano:
is to be supplied, governed by videt. ridere.-
to trust to the lun . Devidson reuds ridere:
to settle on the lund. He informs us that
Pierius found ridere in the most of the en-
cient MSS. ‘rho sense is the seme with
either.

291. Stetit .- she steps piereed with, διο.

294. Num Sz'geie: could they sall upon
the Sigeon vleins? could the captives be
taken? Sto. J uno here speaks es is nothing
less then the protection os the gods, thet
were opposed to ber, could heve saved them
unidst euch havoe end desolation os fire
end swortl. She fiad done her best to de-
stroy them.

Fata Phrygum. Thin may mean the
success or fortune of the Troiam, in ee-
33³¹2¹1¹1³ffi2¹1¹213¹02 ‘'2²:5²5ae fflfffiffissffiffifl
(atis nostri-¹, muy mean the power, will, or
mclinetion of Juno. It was her eernest de-
sire to destroy them au, und she exerted
her utmost power to effect it; but she was
beffled in all her attempta. Their success,
or fortune, prevuiled against her. Or, by
sata Phrygum, we may understand the de·
crees end purpoees os the gods in their favor,
opposed to the will and inclinatione of June,
md beffling all her power.

298. Aut odiis. This is capable of e two-
fold version z 1, sutieted with retentarent,
heve censedz or, satiated, 1 have coued
‘rom my resentment. The sense is the same
either wey.

299. Ere-emm.- expelled or cest from their
country. it is n metaphor taken from a. per-
son's being tost or thrown out of ι οὴυίοῑ.

30⁴. Mun valuit. Pirithoiis, king os the
Lep-the„ invited Δ] the gods to bis nuptiale

with Hippodame, except Maru. This in·
dignity the god revenged upon his subjecte.
The Lapithoe were ι people of Thessaly,
inhabiting mount Pindus. Immunem: navego
—burbarouu or great, luge, in reference
to their aize end stature. This lest seems
to suit the deeign os the speech the best3
which wne to magnify the power os Mun,

in destroying such en enemy. Securi.- re- ¹

gudlees of—sese from.

305. In iras.- in the sense of adpoemm ee
vindictam, says Heyne.

806. Calydona .· ene. sing. of Greek for·
mation, from Calydon, the chief city osAEto-
lia, near the river Evenus. AEnees, its king,
peid bernego to ull the gods, except Diana.
The goddess being provoked ut this neglect,
eent ι wild bour that leid waste his whole
country, tiu be wes sinin by his son Mele-

eger.

307. Quod tantum scelus. Ruaeu- end Dee·
videon heve Lapithis, Calydone merente .- th·
meaning will then be: wbut so eut punieb-
ment did the Lapithae or Calydon deservo?
Scelus is here in the sense of poena vel m -
plicitum .· the punishment for crimes or wiet-
ed actions. Heyne‚ end others, read Lapi-
thas, and Calydona merentem, governed by
the verb emersit understood. In thie cese,
the words may be rendered: deserving what
ztessssizsstzffizhtffssdffl 3:15‘312 3,Ρὸἶέῗέ
If the Lapithoe deserved such signal punish·
ment for neglect shown to Mersz end it
Calydon deserved it sor contemptos Diana,
what do not these Trojens deservo for con-
tempt os me, the wife of Jove, end queen
os the gods? Thus she reasoned. Por the
cause of J uno’s resentment against the Tro·
jeus, see AEn. 1. 4. end 28.
