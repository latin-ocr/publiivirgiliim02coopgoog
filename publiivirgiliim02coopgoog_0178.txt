INTRODUCTION ΤΟ ΤΗΕ AENEID.

Tun AEneid is a heroic, or epic poem. It takes its name from AEneas, the
sna of Anchises and Venus. By his father, he was allied to the royal family of
Troy. He was also the son-in-law of Priam; whose daughter, Creusa, he had
married. AEneas is the hero of the poem. Its subject is his removal into
ltaly with a colony of TrojanS, and their seulement in that country. '

virgil was soi-ty years of age when he commenced the AEneid. He had just
finished the Georgica.- and Augustus, now thirty-three years old, had undis—
turben! possession of the Roman empire. And nothing appeared to interrupt
the universal repose, so desimble aster the long civil wars that had desolat-ed
the sair-est portions of it. lt was at this moment, when the mmds of the Roman
people were turned from the desolating scenes of war to the milder arts of
peace, that the poet conceived the plan of writing the AEneid, a poem second
only to the Iliad, for the entertainment and instruction of his countrymen.
There are some, who think the principa! object of the poet was to flatter the
pride and vanity of the Roman people, and especially Augustus. who was now
raised to the highest temporel power.

This part of liis works is by far the noblest, though not the most perfect and
finished. lt was his intention to have revised it before he published it to the
world ; hut he died leaving it incomplete, as appears by several imperfect lines
found in different parts of it. He bequeathed the whole to AugustuS, who put
the manuscript into the hands os Tucca and Varus for publication, with au
:liiijunction not to alter, in any way, the manuscript, nor to fill up the imperfect

nea.

ln the first six books, Virgil imitates the Odyssey of Homer; in the last six,
he follows the Iliad3 and it is probable that we should not have had the AEneid,
is we had not, at the same time, the Odyssey and the Iliad also. Homer may
be considered the master, virgil the pupil ; but it must, at the same time, be
acknowledged, that the Roman excelled the Grecian in many instances, par-
ticularly in propriety and judgment.

Paris, the son of Priam, an accomplished prince, visited the court of Mene·
laus, by whom he was received with the greatest cordiality. Here he became
enraptured with the beautiful Helen, the wife of his host, and conceived the
base purpose of taking her with him to Troy. Taking advantage of the absence
of her husband, he put his plan into execution. This atrocious deed excited
a general indignation through the states of Greece; and, after sending an
embassy to Troy upon the subject, to no purpose, it was determine-d, as the
last reson-t, to declare war against Priam, and with the united forces of the
Grecian princes, to avenge the perfidious act.

Astur a siege of ten year-8, the city was taken by stratagem, and rased to the
ground. AEneas, in the fatal night, aster persor-ming prodigies of valor, retired
