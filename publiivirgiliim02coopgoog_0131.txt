NOTES.

4⁵. Vox Ancum, &e- The meaning is,
that the groves unite in inviting him, and
echo back the eall.

46. Ardentes.- in the sense of illustres.
accingar .· in the sense of the Greek middle
voice: 1 will prepare myself. The poet
here seems to intimate his purpose of writing
the AEneid ,- which was chiefly designed to
flatter Augustus and the Roman people.

48. ΤίτΙιοηί. Tithonus was either the son
or brother of Laomedon, and greatly belov-
ed by Aurora. From his time down to Au-
gustus. were one thousand years, according
to the best accounts. But to extend his
fame only sor that length of time, would
not come up to the desig-n of the poet, whose
wish was to perpetuata his fame to the la-
test posterity. According to Servius and
nutamine, Tithonus may here be taken for
the sun, in the same sense that Titan is:
they both being derived from the same
Greek verb.¹ This would sully come up to

hy meten. child-bearing itself—the bringing
forth of young in general. Hya-eume:
Hymen or Hymenoeus.. was the son os Bac·
chus and Venue3 the god of marriage: by
meton. marriage itself—-also the intercourse
of the sexes, as in the present instance.
The meaning os the poet is, that the proper
time for cattle to breed, ends before the
tenth, and begins aster the fourth year os
their a .

63. aerea.- in the mean time—between
the years os four and ten, let loose the males

68. lnelementia: rigor—severity.

69. S er mne. This. and the two
followinffines, Dr. Trapp thinks to be aa
interpolation. He says, the sense of the
whole three lines ie extremely jejune and
flat. What occasion of admonishing the
sarmer to continue the succeseion of his
cattle? The thing had just been expreeaed
before. Let it be further considered, what
a different face it puts upon the whole, i!
