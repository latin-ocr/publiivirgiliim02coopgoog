δοοοιιοο ἰι i- now monife-t thet hie predic·
tione ere true. Apollo wne the god, under
whose influenee the Sibyls were, when they
propheeied, or geve out their eracleo.
Apollo wee the non of Jupiter und Latona,
end brother of Diana. June, in order to
vent her ruge against hetone, sent the eer-
pent Python, to vex and torment her. She
was unable ιο find ο place where she could
be delivered of her children in peace, till
N eptune, taking pity en her. raised the inland
Delos, where eho wue sesely delivered of
Apollo and Dione at ο birth. A· soon u
he was born, Apollo slew the serpent Python,
froin which circumstance he ie sometime·
called Pythius. He we· accounted the god
of medicine, music, poetry, ond eloquence,
ull of which, it is auid. he invented. Hi·
son AEecultpiue being killed b Jupiter for
mining the dead, he in turn οἷον the Cy-
clope, who hed made the thunderb'olt that
slew him. Jupiter being much enraged ιι
thie piece os conduct, buniebed him from
heaven, end deprived him os hie dignity.
He cume to Admetus, king os Thes-aly,
and hired himeelf ιο e shepherd, in which
etnployment he served nine years. Hence
he is sometimes called the god of ehepherde.
