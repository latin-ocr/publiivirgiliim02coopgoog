255: Corpora emm Deformat macies;
Exponam tectis, et tristia funera ducunt a

carentum luce

P. VIRGILH MARONJS

tum corpora luce euentum 2⁵5

Aut illae pedibus connexae ad limina pendent,
Aut intus clausis cunctantur in aedibus omnent

Ignavaeque same, et contracto frigore pugroe-

Tum sonus auditur gravior, tractimque susurrant:

Frigidus ut quondam sylvis immurmurat Auster,
Ut mare sollicitum stridet refluentibus undis,
AEstuat ut clausis rapidus fornacibus ignis. ·

Mellaque arundineis inferre canalibus, ultra

Arentesque rosas.. aut igni pinguia multo

Fecere agricolai, facilis quoerentibus herba.
