Et teneram ab radice serens, sylvane, cupressum:
Dique, Deaeque omnes, studium quibus arva tueri,
Quique novas alitis non ullo semine fruges,

Quique satis largum coelo demittitis imbrem.
'l'uque adeo, quem mox quae sint habitura Deorum
Cosedia, incertum est, urbesne invisere, Caesan
'serrarumque velis curam: et te maximus orbis
Auctorem frugum, tempestatumque potentem
Accipiat, cingens materna tempora myrto:

An deus immensi venias maris, ac tua nautae

· KQ sola colant: tibi serviat ultima Thule.¹

NOTES.

er rather, from a Greek word signifying to
neme, because as goddess of war, she
brmdished a spear in her right hand: Par-
menos, becauoe she preserved her chastity:
Tritona, because she was worshipped near a
lake os that name in Africa: Glanoeopim be-
cause she had blue eyes: Agar-ea, because
she presided over markets: Hippio, because
she taught mankind to manage the horse:
3225«, and Area, because of her martial
cter.

19. Puer. Triptolemus the son os Celeus,
king os clusino, a city os Attica. He is
said to have taught the Greeks agriculture,
having himself been previously instructed
by Ceres. See Ecl. v. 79.

20. sylvane. One os those demi-gods that
go under the general name os satyrs. He is
said tohavo been passionately fond os the boy
cyperi-mu, who having, through mistake‚
killed a deer, of which he was very fond,
pined away and died. He was changed into
the Cypress tree. See 1301. 5. 73.

21. Studium: in the sense os cura.

22 Non ullo semine. Some read nonnullo
senine. But the former appears to be the
better: and it is supported by several an·
cient manuscripts, as Pieriis informs us.
A'onullo semine: from no seed, that is, such

9 s tn .

ΩΑ. Adeo.- in the sense of proeeipud.

25. Urbes. The common reading is urbis,-
but as all interpretem agree that it is for
Ιίΐέζυ, the acc. plu. 1 have ventured so to
'nte it. The nom. and acc. plu. os tho
flur-d declensions sometimes ended in eis,
'luch was conti-acted into is,- as, omneis,
mnu-ned omn ie—-utben‘s, contracted urbis.
Bet there is no reason that it should be re-
lpmod in preference to the regular termina-

uon Valpy reads urber-

2⁸. Marimm: the sup. in the sense of
⁰⁸0 poa: the great world.

27. Potentem .· the ruler—one who has
power over: rectorem, says Rusms. It hu
here the force and efficacy os a substantive.
Tempeslolum: in the sense of temporum.

28. Materna myrto. Trio m rtle trce was
sacred to Venus, the mother ο AEneas, from

whom, according to virgil, Caesar descended.

30. Thule. One os the Shetland islanda
on the north of Scotland, the sarthest land
westwurd known to the ancients. The poet,
therefore, calls it ultima. Colunt.- in the
sense of adorent, vel precentur.

31. Tethys. The daughter of Coelus and
Terra, and wife of Oceanus. She was md·
ther of the nymphe Oceanidn5 elegantly
put, by meten. sor the sea itselt'.

32. Anne addas, ko. Or whether you
would add yoursels a new constellation to the
slow summer months. The months are called
slew, because the days in the summer aro
the longest, and so their motion appears the
οἰωνοῖς or rather, to spes-k philosophically,
because the earth moves slower in her orliit,
during the summer months. ,

33. Erigonen. Erigone, the daughter of
Icarus, who, on account os the murder os her
father, hung herself sor grief ς but was
translated to heaven, and made the constel-
lation Virgo. Sequente: Chelas: the follow-
ing claws—the claws following the sign
V irgo. The Cheloe were the claws or arms
of Scorpio, extending over, and oceupying
the sign of Libra. The ancients at first
divided the Ecliptic into eleven parts‚leaving
out the sign Libra, and giving to Scorpio a
space of the Zodiac equal to 600. By re-
ducing it to an equulity with the rest os tho

signs, a space of 300 remained for emar, it'
he chose to occupy it.

34. Ardent.- impatient-—greatly desirous
of thy comingz rather than ardent, burn·
ing, διο. as it is sometimes rendered.
