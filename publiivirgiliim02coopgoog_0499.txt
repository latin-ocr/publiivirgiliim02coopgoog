469. Aciem .- the army of Turnus. Cin

474. Nuntia .· as a messenger—herald.

475. subitus.- in the sense of cubile. Ae.-

476. Radit· excussi.- the shuttle fell from

radii. we ma understand a machine with
spoken comet ing like a wheel, which the
women held in their hands, and on which
thoy wound or reeled the yarn from the spin-
dles, on which it was put, aa it was spun.

What is properly called the episode of
Nisus and Euryalus, ended with the 449th
verse. The lamentation es the ‚mother of
Euryalus most agreeably brings ιιι back to
the subject again, when we imagined we bad
lone with it. Whetlter it be considered a
part of, or a sequel tu, that epiaode, is not
material. It certainly equale, if not exceeda,

her work—labor.

481. Aspicit> hunc le.- dol see that you?
—Is that one 1 see you, O, Euryalus? These
broken half sentences she uttered, while she
behold his head suspended upon the apem

and tells us that the near relatione of the
dead assisted at burial, and were called
Funere. But it ie better to adbere to the
usual acceptation of the word. And ἴδ’, ¹
we may do, if we supply the prop. αἱ before j
it. Produxi may signify the laying out οἱ
the cor-pse for burial, or καλῶς before it ³
to the place of interment. Thin is cousi- ᾗ
dered an intricate passage: and various ’
have been the conjectures upon the proper
construction. Heyne ropoeee nere, sor ,

has been proposed for produxi. He seem· ,
to take funera, with Servius and Scaliger, in χ
the nom. He says, nec ego meter protuli ee

struction proposed above appears thee-‚sim
