ΜΒ. V. 8³1

Phorbanti similis, fuditque has ore loquelas:
laside Palinure, ferunt ipsa aequora classem‚‘
AEquatoe spirant ουτω, datur hora quieti.

Pone caput, fessosque oculos furare labori.

lpse ego paulisper pro te tua munera inibe.
eui vix attollens Palinurus lumina fatur:
Mene salis placidi vultum fluctusque quietos

lgnorare jubes? mene huic confidere monstro?
AEneam credam quid euim fallacibus Austris,

Et coeli toties deceptus fraude sereni?
