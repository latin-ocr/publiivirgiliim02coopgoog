NOTES.

peden .· had returned, or gone thither. The
repetition os the sisse-td, is emphatical.

760. Procedo. Creiisa was the daughter
os Priam, by Hecuba3 which, perhaps, is
the reason of his going to hin palace in
search os her.

761. Asyla : in the sense of templo. Por-
tmbm .· in the passages or aisles.

763. Gaza. This word signifies all kinds
of rich furniture—wealth—property. Itis
o( 11Ροειτίιιι origin. Erepto, is connected
wit it.

764. Mense Deorum. These were the
tripods of the gods„ which served for deli-

763. Undique. This word may implgr, that
the things here mentioned were collected
from all parts of the town, and thr-own in
this place (ἥτις.) or that they were piled up
hereall around--in every part of the building.

770. Ingeminant.- repeating her name in
nin-in vain, because she did not answer
him. Moestns, agrees with ego, understood.

count, sor she was blessed and at rest; but
benun she was the source of sorrow and
pnhappineee to her husband. Umbra. The
mtroduction of Creiisa’s ghost is extremely
son timed. No other expedient could be
found to stop the further search os AEneas
for hi· wife, and permit him to return to his

friends in their expedition. It shows the
judgment of the poet.

778. Imago mnjor nout: her image luget
than life—then when alive. Spectres and
apparitione tre usually represented ot* e
large sizez fear having a tendency to en-
large objectu that are presented to the inm·
gination. The darkness os the night hu ι

Jects seen obscurely and imperfectly.

This episode of Creiisa'a death ie intro-
duced, not merely for the importance of the
event, but because it answered several im-
portant purposes of the poet. It gave him
nn opportunity os more fully illustrating the
piety of AEneas, by showing him once more
exposed to all the dangers ot the war in
search of his wit'e; and, in consequence o!
that, leads us back with his hero to visit
Troy smolxing in its ruins, and makes us
acquainted with several affiicting circum-
stances, without which the narration would
not have been complete. And then it make·
way sor the appearance of her ghost, that
afforde comfort to AEneas in his disti-esa, by
predicting his future felicity; and relieve·
the mind of the render from the horrors ot
war end desolation, by turning him to the
{espect of ῐΙῖιῐ peace andlttrrinquillgy ivilla}
