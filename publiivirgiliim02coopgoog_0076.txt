INTRODUGTION ΤΟ ΤΙΙΕ &Eone-les-

 

 

ΤΗΙ civil wara, that had distracted the Roman empire, had nearly desolated
tuly. The land lay neglected, and the inhabitants were reduced to great dis·
tren sor want of the necessat-ies os life. In this state of things, they cast the
blame upon Augustus, and murmured against his administration. To remedy
the existing evils, and to avert beavier calamities, it became necessary to revive
agriculture3 which for many years had been almost wholly neglected, the peo-
ple being taken from their lands to supply the armies. Ιι occurred to Maecenas
that a treatise upon that subject would be highly useful to the inhabitants of
Italy ς he therefore engaged virgil, who had just finished his Eclogues, to
undet-take the work. Ῑι had the desired effect. For, aster the publication of
the Georgica, ltaly began to assume a new and flourishing appearance, and the
people found themselves in plenty, and in the enjoyment os peace and content.

virgil spent about seven years in this p’art os his works. His correct taste,
his chaste style, and above all, his extensive knowledge, duly qualified him sor
a work os this kind. The Georgics, like the Eelogues, were every where well
received.

The rules for the improvement of husbandry, and the advice given ιο the
flii-mer upon the several subjecte connected with it, were not only suited to tne
climate of Italy, but have been esteemed valuable in every country where “due
honor has been paid ιο the plougn, ' down to the present time.

'l'he word Georgica is from the Greek. Its original word properly significo
the cultivation or tillage os the earth. In. the Georgics, Vi il imitated Hesiod,
who wrote a treatiee upon this subject, entitled, Opera et “ , but he far ex·
celled him in every respect. He began this part of his works in the year ot*
Rome 717, being then about thirty-two years os age, and dedicated it to Mm-
eenas, his friend and patron, at whose request he wrote it.

The Georgica are divided into four books. The first treats os the various
soils, and the proper method os managing each. The second treats of the various
ways of propagating fruit trees, and particularly the vine. The third treats of
the several kinds of grass, and the proper method of raising horses, cattle,
sheep, and goats. The fourth treats of the proper management of bees.

With the main subject, the poet bath interwoven several very interesting sables
and episodes, which contributa to our pleasure, and relieve the mind under the

diyness os precept.
