NOTES.

28. Erebi .· the place of the dead—the in-
fernal regions.

27. Ante‘. Tho ante here ie plainly ex-
pletive. Pria-s goes before it, and is to be
connected with qudm. Some copies have
violem and resolvam. Pudor.- in the sense
of pudicitia.

30. Implccit sinum .· she filled her bosom
with flowing tem. Servius and Turnebus
take sinum, here, for the cavity os the eye.
But the common import os the word ia much
more expressive, ae it shows her teate to be
much more copinas.. and painte her passion
aa more violent. Refert.- in the nense os
respmadet. Luce .· in the senso of mla.

3⁹2. Sola-ne carpere: will you sade and
wither away, mourning alone aa a widow
through all your youth, Sec. Ruaeue says,
on mla consumeris dolens per lolam Juventu-
tem. But carpere may be used‚in the sense
ps the Greek middle voice. The meaning
is obvious.

35. Nulli mariti.- no suitora moved you
nerrowing—while your losa wne fresh in
3252'21.”·¹⁰1¹1¹.¹‘}l,{'..⁸1?.‘2 ἔέοζῖοᾶήθῖεέῗὲἳῗῗῗὶ
tha conoe of dolentem. Tc ia understood.

86. Iarbas. Among the many who made
ruit to Dido, was Iarbas, a rich and power-
sal prince ol' Africa, and reputed eon os
J· iter Ammon. But Juatin gives a very
dt erent account of the matter from the one
giren here by the poet. lle says, Iarbas,
nai-ing gotten ten of the principal Cartha-
Quiane, demanded of them Dido in mar—
ηερε and. in cue of a refusal, he threaten-
ed to declaro war against them. Fearing
to deliver the message to the queen, they
nid the king demanded a person who might
[ouh him and hia people the arts of civilized
affe: but that no one could be found who wan

undertake the businca„ upon thia the queen
rebuked them,and declared that if t'ne aasety
of his country required it, any one shoutd
be willing to give up even his lise. They
then opened the whole matter, aaying, the
ἔίἷῖιὲᾞὲἕευῗ-ῗέ ›lgisf‘j'ff-‘tssss azstlzztzslss
the good of the city. Being taken by this
device, aster much lamentatione, and many
invocatione of her husband, she deelared
that she would obey the call ot* her country.
flaving passed three mont-hs in this manner,
elie caused a funeral pile to be erected in
one part of the city, aa if to appense the
Manes os her departcd husband, and to offer
sacrifices sor him before her nuptials. She
ascendcd the pile, and taking a swerd in hm·
hand, said to her people, that she would go
to her husband as they required, and, with
her own hand, put an end to her existence.
While Carthage rcmained, slie was womliip-
ped aa a goddesri.

87. Terra die-er triumphis. lt appears from
Servius, that the Africana were the inventore
of triumplial shows. Some say they never
triumphed. But Justin tella us that Asdru-
bal, in particular, was honored with four
triumphs. Placizo: in the sense os grato
Νε is interrogative.

40. (Μαῖα urbes. The Getuli were a
brave and warlike people, to the south of
Carthago. Ηίηε, when it has its corree-
pondent hinc, the former is rendrred, on tlte
one ride ,- and tho latter, οη. the other side.

41. Numidoe. The Numidians, again, were
a people fierce and uncivilized‚ lying to the
westward. Jnhospiea Syrna Both tho
greater and the less Syrtis lay in ¹¹19 Sinus
Libycus, to the north and east of Carthago
and rendered tlte navigationi dangeroun.

42. Deserta nei rendered desert br

'illia‘ to leave hir relations and friends to drought.
