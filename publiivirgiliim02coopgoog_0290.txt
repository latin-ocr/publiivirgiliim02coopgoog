Nec minus Andromache, digressu moesta supreme,

Fert picturatas auri subtemine vestes,

Et Phryssiam Ascanio chlamydem 3 nec cedit honori ε

484. chlamydem. The Chlsmys was pro-
perly s. military germont, a cassock, which
tho genes-sl wore over his corslet. It was
embroidered with needlework, os which tho
Phrygiam were the inventore. Nee cedit
honori.- nor does she fan below her dignity.
Nee mate respondet eius dignitati, says Ruaeus.
Scaurus explains tho word thus: non cedit
Heleno liberalitate et munificentia, taking
honori sor honore in the abl. Servius says,
Tanta dat munem, quanta merebatur Asea-
m'us .· hor is her bounty disproportionote to
the merit and quality of its object.

two Greek words, end signifies the king of
s. city. After the destruction of Troy, tho
Greeks were delnyed sor some tune stom
returning home by contrary winde. In the
mean time, Chalcus, their augur end pro-

is extremely delicate und moving. lt is tho
voice ofnsture. She immediately adds: Et
stunc, «ilc. This suggests the delight she
would have felt to have seen Iulus, and As·

unu together, engaged in friendship, end

1t may be obser-ved, that while Helenus
gives presente to Anchises und AEness, An-
dromache is entirely taken up with Asca·
nius, and the recollection of her lost Astya-
nax. She confines her gista to him alone.
